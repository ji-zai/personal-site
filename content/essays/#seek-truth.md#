title: Seeking truth is the only skill

### Why seek truth?

A truth is a reality of a system. A system is anything that has some phenomena happening inside of it. Physics, biology, chemistry, are all systems with varying events, characteristics and rules that govern them.

Because a truth is aligned with reality, it exists whether someone observes it, understands it, or even is that even the way to do things? Fascinating don't you think so? That is surely fascinating if you ask me.

A pure text solution just feels right. Everything backed up to GIT. No distractions whatsoever (keep the internet on, but basically delete all browsers and disable Safari for now. Make this a pure writing machine for this phase (to the extent possible). Just stick to the damn writing, and eventually things will take care of themselves. Amen.

Skill in seeking truth is the same thing as skill in getting what you want. Therefore, if you're a human being that wants, then you'd benefit from learning how to seek truth more effectively, to the extent that it's possible to do so.

I also want to be able to operate everything from the keyboard when in the writing mod.e The keyboard only,text only experience feels right to em for some reason. Not quite sure why. Just text. Work with just text. The most efficient way to represetn and communicate information. 

Do you really want to get into Emacs? I do. I just want a simpler interface, and I don't want to have to deal with 

Therefore, skill in seeking truth lies at the foundation of any skill that we value, because any skill exists only if it enables you fulfill a certain kind of want. Skill in seeking truth lies at the core of skill in building a great company (a want to make a product people want, skill making great art (a want to express yourself).

You might wonder that such a general definition makes it useless. Of course when defined this way seeking truth is the only skill. But the generality is precisely where the value of studying this lies. 

If seeking truth is the most fundamental skill, then studying it should tell us more about the nature of learning, how to improve our ability to learn, to understand. It will show us which aspects of this skill are generalizable to any skill, and which are specific to what you're doing.

Using "Seeking truth" to define such a fundamental skill is useful because it's opinionated in a way that sheds more light on the nature of the process. "Seeking" implies that it is a search problem. And "truth" implies that there is some objectivity to it - that there is in fact a notion of "better" for any skill, that it's not entirely subjective.

And therefore, using this phrase to describe the most fundamental skill is far more useful than using something like "learning", "growing", etc. which don't offer such a glimpse into what it means.

Why study seeking truth when there's already so much wisdom around it? After all, in today's mainstream culture, phrases like "learn by doing", "the more you do, the better you get", or "you need to be resilient to do great work" are commonly used to describe how to get better at skills.

While I believe these advices are directionally correct, they can be dangerous when followed blindly.

For example, someone blindly following "resilience is required" may not choose to quit a path even though that's objectively the right thing to do to enable them to succeed. Someone who blindly follows "learn by doing", may not carve out the optimal time to study how to do it from those that are great.

And when we follow "the more you put out, the better you get", we assume that rate of output is the most important way to measure learning all of the time. And yet 

Dogmatic understanding of what it means to seek truth will lead us astray, if not now, then eventually.

Then there's the catch all term "judgement": knowing when to do what. We're advised to have better judgement so that we don't fall into the traps of dogmatically following approaches. Of course, this would be incredibly useful to train, but what does this mean and how do you get better at it? Is the only way to train this to keep performing your skill? Or are there other techniques we can use to improve this?

And then there's the "you can only answer these questions by doing". Once again, I think this advice is correct directionally, but creates the dangerous impression that there is nothing else that can be done to improve your rate of learning.

Therefore, to understand how true these pieces of advice are, and to see if there are any ways to get better at getting better itself, we have no choice but to study seeking truth with enough nuance and detail to hopefully help us form some useful opinions about the nature of learning itself.

Where do we start?

The only place we can start is by understanding how the mind works.

Any wisdom about how to improve assumes a theory of mind, whether it's explicit or implicit. "Resilience" is only required if the mind struggles when learning. "Doing is the best way to learn" implies that when the mind intellectualizes a skill, it's not enough to be good at it. We need to try and understand what aspects of the mind causes these behaviors.

When we have a more nuanced, precise theory of how the mind operates, how it seeks truth, and what can be done to change how it operates to improve our truth seeking ability, we should be able to derive and define all of the commonly used terms related to seeking truth.

And if there isn't much else we can do than just learn by performing any skill over and over again, at least we'll know why.

### The mind has a representation of what it believes is true.

Let's call this representation a our "model" of what we believe are the truths about the world.

We act according to this model in order to get the things that we want.

We fail to get what we want when:
1. Our model doesn't yet have sufficient truth about the systems that governs our want.
2. Or, if our model is sufficiently mis-aligned from reality.
3. Or, despite having a good enough model, we cannot act on it for some reason.

The first scenario is when you don't feel you know exactly what to do to get what you want. The second is when you believe you know what to do to get what you want, but when you try it, you fail to get what you want. The last is the unfortunate situation of knowing exactly what to do, being aligned with reality, and yet unable to act on it for whatever reason.

To make our model more concrete, let's think of it as a spreadsheet with many rows, each corresponding to a truth the mind believes in. Obviously this is not how the mind represents information, but it offers us a valuable starting point to understand how the mind works at a high level, before we explore how it represents information in the framework of the brain / body.

Each row would have the following columns:
1. Your truth (a statement describing what you believe).
2. Confidence (how much you believe that your truth is actually aligned with reality).
3. Value (how much the mind values this truth - depending on how much it thinks this truth will help you get what you want as fast as possible.).

The "value" field of each row depends on what you want in that moment. And of course, you only value a truth if it helps you fulfill what you want in that moment.

There are 2 ways in which your model can be mis-aligned with reality: the degree to which your truth is wrong, and the degree to which you've "mis-valued" a truth: the degree to which what you thought it was worth (to help you get what you want) is different than what it was actually worth.

This implies there is an objectively "correct" value for a truth.

---
### How does the mind value a truth?

From nature's perspective, things just exist, and value can only be assigned by something that wants since only a being that wants has a notion of one truth being better than the other to help them get what they want. If you have no wants, there's no sense to value one truth over another.

Therefore, how the mind values a truth depends on your want. The value represents the degree to which the mind believes that this truth will enable you to get what you want. The mind values one truth more than another if it gets you more of what you want, more quickly.

Predictive power and relevance determine a truth's value.

Predictive power is how much that truth tells about the systems that govern your want.

For someone building a bridge, the truth about the formula for gravity is far more valuable than the truth: "when you throw something up, it will fall back down".

From the perspective of this engineer, both are true, but the formula for gravity tells them a lot more about the system they're operating in. They're able to predict how the system will behave without having to see that behavior.

They can tell a lot more because they can derive a variety of behaviors from the formula for gravity. A truth is more fundamental the more things that can be derived from it.

They know what forces will act on the bridge and can therefore plan for it without having to go through the process of building something that doesn't work, having it break, and then learning from it. This is invaluable.

Yet, a powerful truth is useless to you if it doesn't help them you what you want, i.e. it's not relevant to you.

For a person in a village who desperately needs to build a boat to get across a large body of water, e = mc^2 isn't valuable at all, even though it is an incredibly powerful truth that tells a lot about the world we live in.

Therefore, relevancy is critical for the mind to value a truth.

Another way to look at it is:
- Relevancy is how aligned it is with your want.
- Power is the magnitude of the truth.

It may seem that the way a person values a truth is purely subjective, and changes from person to person. But there is an objective quality to it.

Two people with the same exact want will eventually converge at the same values for truths.

For example, world leaders who want to keep their countries safe would all value greatly the truths about how nuclear weapons operate.

Let's define "true value" of a truth (for a specific want) to be the value that someone who has the want, and a complete understanding of all the systems that govern that want, would assign to this truth.

The more different two individuals' wants are, the less we can objectively compare how much better one is valuing a truth than the other.

Therefore, I believe subjectivity exists to the extent that we want different things. And looking at the world it definitely seems that there is rich variety of human wants, and therefore it's difficult to compare how two people value truths.

But, this notion of "true value" becomes productive when we use it to compare how we value truths to ourselves in the past, for the same want. Improving the way we value a truth such that we get closer to assigning it a value closer to the "true value" is a key component of becoming better at what we do.

Let's call how the mind values a truth the "value function": a function that, for a particular want, and truth combination, returns a value for it. For now, to help us visualize our model, let's treat this value as a positive integer.

---
### Seeking truth is to reduce delusion in our model, and increase its highest value

Delusion in our model is the degree to which our value function is incorrect. A perfect value function would value wrong statements with 0, and will work its way up from there with more, and more powerful truths that help us get what we want.

It's only when we fully understand exactly how to get what we want, and we know it's aligned with reality (i.e. acting on it always gets us what we want), that we can see the true values for all the truths we've uncovered along the way.

In other words, we only see our delusion looking backwards. If we could see exactly what we're deluded about right now then we wouldn't be deluded about it.

This makes sense from our experience as a beginners. We don't really know what we're not doing well, though we can often see that it's not "great" by comparing ourselves with those that we think are great at the skill. When we get better, we can look back and see our foolishness due to the delusion we had in the past.

Reducing delusion isn't enough, our best truth needs to have sufficient value to fulfill our want. Someone that wants something but doesn't know how to get it still has work to do.

This means that a want has a notion of a "fulfillment value": the minimum value of the top valued truth in our model that, if were to act on, would fulfill this want. And when we don't have a sufficiently valued truth, it means our model doesn't have enough information to enable us to get what we want.

But, "not knowing" is also a form of delusion: your model is mis-aligned with reality because the model of reality would contain all the truths of reality. And therefore, to seek truth is simply minimize delusion: of which there are multiple kinds. And we'll see soon that there is delusion in how we seek truth as well.

So now we know what our model is, how the mind values truths, and that reducing delusion is how we make our model good enough to get what we want.

---
### What happens when we want something?

Firstly, our model is updated to reflect the values for this want. It must do this since our value function depends on the current want.

When our model is updated with the values for this want, the mind picks the top valued truth from the model and judges whether it can fulfill the want or not (i.e. whether the best value >= want's fulfillment value).

When your best truth fulfills your want, and you know exactly how to act on it, there is no need for seeking truth. You have all the truths you need to act and get what you want.

For example, you feel hunger, you want to eat something, and your best truth is that your fridge contains sufficient leftovers from brunch, and you simply act on this truth and go eat it. No need to seek truth.

When our best truth does not fulfill our want, we seek truth in order to improve our model so that the best truth can get us what we want.

---
### The mind seeks truth by observing, understanding, valuing, and predicting.

To observe is to perceive something happening. You can perceive this through any of your senses: see, hear, taste, feel, smell, or thinking (i.e. observing a thought). 

An observation is the trigger for adding a new row to the model.

As soon as the mind observes something, it tries to understand it. In the way we've designed our model, to understand is to write a statement that describes the observation.

When an understanding happens, the mind assigns a value to this new truth, for the current want, using its value function.

To predict is to guess other truths based on the ones already in your model. The mind tries to predict the truths that will help you get what you currently want.

A prediction is nothing but another row in your model, often with less confidence than the truths that you've derived directly from an observation. This makes sense as a guess wouldn't be a guess if you already had high confidence in it.

When a prediction adds a truth to the model, the value function assigns a value to it.

The mind may predict through a variety of methods. For example, it may try to connect an existing truth to a new truth by asking questions, or maybe by a feeling. But regardless of the underlying mechanism (which we'll get to later), the end result is that a prediction produces a truth with some level of confidence (i.e. a hunch / guess).

Each step in this cycle is a reaction. An understanding is a reaction to an observation or prediction. A prediction is a reaction to an understanding.

But where does an observation come from? I don't believe it comes from a void and that it's a direct reaction to a want.

When you want something, the mind is primed to observe things that it believes will fulfill your want.

Through all the senses, we consume a great deal of information, yet only a small fraction of that information rises to our conscious mind in a way that we can observe. What we want influences what reaches our conscious mind. And how intensely we want influences what our mind observes: the more intense, the more observations will be ones that your mind believes are more directly related to fulfilling your want. (note: easy to show this with example: tiger chasing you).

A want gives energy to this cycle. When the want dies down (either when it's fulfilled, or when it gets weaker on its own as a result of not being satiated for a long time) this cycle no longer has the energy to keep going. (probably want to keep this later).

Similar to how there is an objective quality to the mind's value function (a person with the same want will value truths equally given sufficient truth seeking), there is an objective quality to how well the mind predicts new truths from existing ones.

---
### The mind predicts based on its notion of similarity between two truths.

For a person who wants to get across a lake, the truths: "wood floats on water", and "a sail can propel with wind", are far more similar than the truth "gold sinks in water" is with either of them.

Why is that? Because a person who wants to get across a body of water is probably not going to predict something about the floating nature of gold in water, as it's so unrelated to what they want. Similarly, they wouldn't predict the kind of insects that live in the wood after they understand "wood floats on water".

In other words, the similarity between two truths is the likelihood of you predicting one as a reaction to the understanding of the other.

Similarity doesn't seem to fully depend on the value the truths. You won't always predict truths that are valuable, and more often than not you'll predict a bunch of truths that are useless before you start to predict more useful ones. 

So similarity(t1, t2) and value(t) seem to be independent functions.

Similarity also impacts what you observe, because an observation can be a reaction to a prediction, and so if the similarity function determines prediction, it will impact observation since you'll only create experiments for what you predict. (note: what about the observation that is a direction reaction to a want and not a prediction?)

This similarity function creates "clusters" of truths. Therefore, as you seek truth, you'll tend to understand it in clusters.

Over time, as you understand more of the systems that govern your want, you'll realize that some clusters are much closer than you initially thought they were. (todo: show a good example for this).

Similar to the value function, there is a sense of objectivity to the similarity function, or in other words there's a "true similarity" between two truths, for a given want.

Two individuals with the same want, given infinite time to seek truth, will eventually converge on the same similarity function. They'd have no choice but to see the similarity between two truths that initially seemed far apart if those two truths work together to help them get what they want.

And there is subjectivity how good a similarity function is to the extent that the wants that they are based on are different (similar to the subjectivity of the value function).

Therefore, as you improve, your similarity function should objectively become better for a given want.

---
### Seeking truth is a recursive search problem.

Eventually by seeking truth (observing, understanding, valuing, predicting), the mind finds a truth with sufficient value that could fulfill your current want.

Earlier, we saw that when you have a truth that fulfills your want, and you know how to act on it, then you'll simply act on it and get what you want. But there's one more scenario that we didn't cover: **when you don't know how to act on a truth that will get you what you want.**

In this situation (and it's the most common situation we find ourselves in), we need to seek truth about how to act on this truth, in order to get what we want.

For example, let's say you want to build a software product to solve a problem that you have. By seeking truth (observing, understanding, valuing, predicting), you eventually predict that a particular product will solve the problem, i.e. will satisfy your want, and you've described it in great detail: drawings, descriptions, etc. 

But, if you don't know how to build the product (by actually coding and building the software), then despite having a truth with sufficient value, you cannot act on it.

When this happens, a new want is generated: **the want to act on your best truth**, so that you can get what you want.

This want is a sort of "child" want to the "parent" want of building a product to solve a problem. In order to fulfill the parent want, the child want must be fulfilled, and so another cycle of seeking truth starts.

For this child want, your mind again observes, understands, values, predicts to generate better truths that can fulfill it. For example, a prediction may be that your friend knows how to do this and that you should be able to convince him to help you. Another prediction may be that you can build it yourself by learning how to code.

As you can see, each of those develops more child wants, that require more truth seeking. If you want to get your friend's help, the truth seeking will be about what would be the best way to convince him (i.e. what does he want, and how to make the best pitch). If you want to build it yourself, you will seek truth about the want to learn how to build software.

The search resembles a tree: with your first want at the root, with children wants and their children wants.

But, unless some child want doesn't generate more child wants, then this process would go on forever without ever getting what you want.
### When is a want satiated?

It may seem that a want ends when it's fulfilled, but from our life experiences we know that's the opposite of what happens. When we satiate a want, it comes back with higher expectations (i.e. a higher fulfillment value).

On the other hand, not fulfilling a want and making it run out of patience doesn't necessary destroy the want, it only appears again with lower expectations (i.e. lower fulfillment value).

To be clear, this patience is the want's patience, not ours. A want doesn't simply disappear because we want it to. It disappears when it's exhausted by your inability to satiate it.

Anyone who's ever tried to stick to a diet will know that want to eat junk food while not wanting to want that. The only way to overcome that want is to wait it out. You may wait it out by trying to distract yourself with something else, or you may pay attention to it and let it pass. But either way it's delusional to think that we have direct control over when our want ends. We only have control over the factors that lead to the end of the want, and simply thinking the thought "I want this want to end" will not cause it to end.

And I believe that this patience of a want is related to the fulfillment value. The higher the fulfillment value of the want, the much longer it will wait for you to fulfill it before disappearing.

Satiation is only temporary. And this mechanism can be a good thing: it means you will keep improving.  For example, someone wanting to build a product to solve a problem will never satiate that want. They will continue to improve their product even after launching the first version that may technically fulfill their want.

This is why artists, entrepreneurs, and anybody, continue to improve for the majority of their lives. It's only when you fail to satiate a want for an extended period of time, that it withers out.

There seem to be some wants that wither out when not satiated, whereas others don't (such as the want for food, water). But I think for the sake of this discussion, we can ignore these needs by assuming they will be met.
### Satiation happens on the journey to get what you want, and when you get what you want.

It may seem that satiation happens only when you get what you want, but in reality it happens every single time you have a truth in your model that your mind believes will fulfill the current want.

In other words, the mind is rewarded when it sees a path to fulfill your want, in addition to being rewarded when you actually get what you want. This happens when a truth is added to your model with a sufficient value to fulfill the want.

Perhaps this is why we have a tendency to derive joy from the pursuit rather than the destination since we are rewarded each step of the way to get there.

And I think it's also true that the satiation in the path to get what we want is inherently different than the satiation of getting the want itself.

But, for now let's assume both the satiation from seeking truth and the satiation from getting what you want are the same type of satiation, but just different values, and that satiation can be represented by a single positive integer. We'll intentionally add this delusion into how we represent the mind to make it easier to visualize it. And when this delusion prevents us from understanding something, we'll try to dig deeper.
### The mind updates in response to satiation, or the lack of it.

Satiation conditions the mind by reinforcing the path the mind took to get to the satiation.
Lack of satiation reverses the reinforcement of the path the mind took to get to the lack of satiation (deconditioning).

Lack of satiation is simply time elapsed since satiation. And since time is a factor, this looks like a continuous process with updates happening for the currently active want each moment this want is active. (note: this is likely discrete with a small interval, using moment as a placeholder).

When satiation happens, the want's patience is replenished according to magnitude of satiation. And every moment after that, some patience is used up until there is no more patience left.

When no more patience is left, the want disappears, and will likely reappear with a similar or lower fulfillment value at some future time.

What exactly is updated during an update (that happens each moment)?

The model and the functions of the mind are updated to either condition or de-condition the path to this satiation.

1. The observation function is now more likely to observe things that are similar to what it observed leading to this satiation.
2. The understanding function will double down on whatever it did to interpret the observation.
3. The value function will double down on valuing truths in the same way it valued the truths that led to this satiation.
4. The similarity function will double down on finding new truths in the same way it did that led to this satiation.

Each function doubles down on what it did to achieve this satiation.

And similarly, each moment that passes in which the want isn't satiated, the mind de-conditions the path that led to this lack of satiation.

How is the conditioning different from the de-conditioning? I believe they are different, but we'll explore how later on. (todo: have better transitions).
### We don't just believe, we are addicted to our beliefs.
### We have a single "origin want" that all other wants fall under.

### Our attention focuses on one want at a time.
### Summarizing our theory of mind
- Seeking truth only makes sense in the context of wanting something. No want = no seeking truth.
- We have an internal model for what we believe to be true. For now, we're representing this model with a spreadsheet with rows; each row corresponding to: { truth, confidence, value} where the truth is an English statement describing the belief, confidence is a number 0 - 1 that represents how confident you are in this truth, and its value (positive integer) represents how much your mind values this truth to help you get what you currently want.
- The value for a truth is tied to the current want. When the want changes, the values in the model are updated to reflect the new want.
- Delusion is the degree to which your model is mis-aligned with reality. The more delusion that exists in your model, the more wrong it is, and the less you are able to get what you want by following your model.
- When a want shows up, it comes with a fulfillment value: the value that the best truth for this want needs to have in order for this want to be satiated.
- When a want shows up:
	- If the best valued truth for the want suffices, and you know exactly how to act on it, you will simply act on it, to fulfill it.
	- If the best valued truth for the want suffices, but it doesn't have enough information to be acted on fully, then whatever can be acted on will be acted on, a child want is created to understand how to act on it, and truth seeking for that child want begins.
	- If the best valued truth for the want doesn't suffice to fulfill it, you will seek seek truth to find out a good enough truth that can fulfill the current want.
- There are 4 functions of the mind that comprise of the truth seeking process.
	- Observe: to perceive something through one of your senses.
	- Understand: to translate an observation in to statement that represents the truth you believe in.
	- Value: to assign a value to a truth based on how much it will enable you to get what you want.
	- Predict: to guess more truths based on what you already believe in.
- Each is a reaction to the previous: observe -> understand -> value -> predict.
- And the "observe" itself is a reaction to a want. What you want triggers the mind to start observing things that fulfill the want, and the cycle of seeking truth begins.
- Each function has an objective and subjective component to it. Two people with the same want, who have full understanding of all the systems that govern their want (without any delusion) will want the same exact observation, understanding, value, and prediction functions. Subjectivity only occurs based on degree of delusion and degree of difference in the want.
- As discussed above, when the best valued truth fulfills the want, and you don't know how to act on it, a child want is generated to understand how to act on it. This process of generating child wants that can have their own child wants turns this into a recursive tree search problem.
- A want rarely "ends" as expected, it only comes back with greater or lower fulfillment value by calibrating itself based on whether it has been satiated or not. If the want is satiated, it disappears temporarily and returns with a higher fulfillment value (i.e. is calibrated to have higher expectations this time around). When a want isn't fulfilled for an extended period of time it too temporarily disappears and returns with a lower fulfillment value (i.e. is calibrated to have lower expectations).
- This means a want has a notion of patience: how long it lasts before temporarily disappearing when it has not been fulfilled. This is the patience of the want, not your patience.
- Satiation occurs on the path to getting what you want - whenever you generate a child want and go deeper in the tree. In other words, whenever the mind finds a path to getting what it wants, it will generate some satiation.
- The mind updates based on satiation / lack of it. This update happens each moment.
- The update is nothing but conditioning the path that led to satiation, and de-conditioning the path the longer it goes without satiating. This conditioning impacts all the functions of the mind and model.
### Testing our model of the mind
### Delusion compounds

What should be clear is that 
### Seeking truth follows a power law
### What makes us suck at seeking truth?
- We move too slow. Less update() means less learning.
- We move too fast and miss out on valuable predictions that would have led us down significantly better branches.
- Our attention is divided between too many wants, out of our control.
- We choose the wrong paths to explore.
- Bias:
	- The more satiation we obtain from a path, the more addicted we become to that branch through conditioning, and the more difficult it is to explore other branches.
	- When we perceive information through our senses, oftentimes they don't even reach our conscious mind to be able to form an observation, because the information contradicts a path we are deeply addicted to, and therefore our addiction prevents us from seeing it.
	- When an information becomes an observation, if it contradicts with a path we are deeply addicted to, we are more likely to observe it in a way that is more aligned with the paths we are deeply addicted to.
	- When the mind understands an observation that contradicts a deeply addicted to path, the mind will understand it in a way that minimizes the contradiction (or somehow makes it aligned).
	- When the mind understands an observation in a way that contradicts a deeply addicted to path, the mind will tend to value it low, and not focus on it, which means that the mind won't generate predictions for it.
- In day to day life, this bias manifests: when someone tells us where we are wrong, we become defensive when what they say goes against a path we are addicted to.
- When we become addicted to the satiation from a lower want, we re-organize our tree by making that lower want a higher want. (i.e. changing our wants entirely). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but from the perspective of seeking truth for a specific want, this makes us suck at it because we can avoid it altogether.
- We don't have the patience to overcome a want's patience by seeing it through, and therefore we succumb to its temptation even though we may not consciously want to.
### What are the underlying factors for our blunders?
1. Lack of control over attention.
2. Allowing the mind to be addicted to paths that we traverse further down on, and our beliefs.
3. We don't have a strong enough muscle to resist acting on wants that we don't want to act on.
4. 

But, how to overcome these blunders?
