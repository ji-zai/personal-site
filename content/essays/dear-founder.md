Seeking truth is the most important skill for founders to succeed. It enables you to manage stress, make better decisions and be far more productive.

It's easier to say "the market wasn't there yet", than:

“I decided to shut down the company even though I believe the market will be strong in five years, but I don’t have the patience to wait that long because of my craving to appear successful in the eyes of my family and friends. I can’t stand the thought of everyone thinking I’m a failure for possibly five more years, so I'm going to try to find a product angle that'll generate money quickly.”

It's easier to say "we ran out of money", than:

"I believe we could pull it off if I fired everyone, and the cofounders and I move to more_affordable_place to extend our runway by a couple of years as we patiently grinded it out. But I have friends here. I like my apartment and oh, I just had a date with this really cool person and want to explore a future with them that I believe is more important than this company."

It's easier to say "we didn't find the growth we needed", than:

"I decided to stop working on my company because after spending 2 years on it, I realized it wasn't a problem I cared about deeply. I didn't want to squander a decade of my life working on something I'm not passionate about."

It's easier to say "our competition raised way more money than we did, therefore we couldn’t compete", than:

"Every time I hired someone I felt more powerful. I was addicted to this feeling of power and ended up hiring a bunch of people too quickly after I raised a series A. But then the first few incompetent hires hired more incompetent people leading to an incompetent company. We couldn't ship shit. I can't fire half the team now and then spend time hiring more competent people because then I'll look like an asshole and also incompetent for hiring terribly. So I'm going to accept defeat, shut down the company and blame it on competition in order to protect my reputation."

You don't have to be this honest with the people you talk to, but you absolutely must brutally honest with yourself.

The truth is difficult to see because your ego will do its best to prevent the truth from entering your conscious mind. Your ego makes many decisions on your behalf in the subconscious as a coping mechanism to protect your sense of self-worth.

Fight that cope.

In the process of finding the truth, you pull the decisions being made for your in your subconscious, into your conscious mind, giving you greater control over your destiny.

It’s only when you see, and accept the truth for what it is, that you can change yourself in the ways you want to.

Despite all of its drawbacks, the ego also helps you make better decisions when you see the truth.

The ego has such a beautiful, pristine self-image that it is always trying to glorify. By accepting reality you shatter that self-image, and you give your ego no choice but to take the decision that is in line with the self-image it wants.

For example, many founders say that they want to put the company above themselves. But when you dig into the reality of your decisions, you’ll realize that many decisions were rooted in the desire to appear a certain way to the world which may not have been the best for the company. 

But, when you actually realize that truth about a decision you’re about to make, your ego will force you to take the path that is actually good for the company - because that is what your conscious mind actually values.

Because despite all of our flaws, we have this thirst for internal consistency. When reality is inconsistent with the self-image that your ego craves, it will work in a frenzy to bridge that inconsistency. And rather than pull down its desired self-image, it will try to change reality to match the self-image it wants. And that’s a good thing because it will pull you towards your high bar, rather than pull the bar down.

Therefore, once you realize the truth about why you want to do something, the greatest effort is behind you, since your mind will work overtime to combat any internal inconsistencies that stem from accepting the truth.

It’s easy to see contradictions in others because their ego can’t manipulate your view of their reality, but it’s incredibly difficult to see your own. Find peers that will give you honest feedback, allowing you to see past your own self-delusions.

Accepting the truth is relaxing for the mind.

Internal tension rises when decisions made in your subconscious contradict the self-image your ego craves.

Because somewhere deep down, your mind knows what the truth is. The more you let your ego bend your conscious perception of the truth, the more tension it generates in the mind.

While seeking truth is incredibly painful, when you accept the truth, your mind will be less tense than it was while holding that internal inconsistency.

The more tension you have, the more difficult it becomes to make good decisions. Managing stress well is critical for any founder (and anybody for that matter). Relentless seeking truth is a great tool to manage your stress.

You'll also be far more productive.

When you're brutally honest with yourself, you'll realize that you yourself are the root cause of all of your problems and you'll begin to take more ownership.

When you take more ownership, your mind will naturally try to find solutions to your problems because it believes you have control.

For example, when your product involves hardware and you don’t have the resources to manufacture it, you’ll ask yourself if you can start with the software aspect of that product and get traction for that first… and you’ll probably see that you can.

If your product requires a lot of compute to, say, train AI models, then you’ll ask yourself who you could donate some resources to you, leading you to cold email hundreds of technologists and researchers around the world politely asking to borrow some compute to train your model... and you'll see that they'll help.

There's always a way. It's only a question of whether you genuinely want it, or just want to want it.

I’m not saying external factors never impact your outcomes. But you should only reach the conclusion that the source of your failure is external after ruthlessly exhausting all possibilities to take full responsibility for your actions. And even then, be extremely cautious... your ego is an expert at clouding your view of reality. After all, its spent its entire existence learning how to manipulate you.

As AI and technology mature, you will have greater leverage than you can imagine, and even fewer valid excuses. What required large teams and years to build will be achievable by an individual in days. You can build great products and generate revenue without raising a dollar. A tiny team can punch orders of magnitude above its weight. You can reach most individuals in the world through the internet.

The only thing stopping you is yourself.

*This essay is directed towards a younger, weaker version of myself that spent too much effort coming up with excuses for his failures, without realizing that his problem - and solution - was in his own mind.*

[1] This is why I’m not a fan team cultures that emphasize “low egos”. I often find these teams full of people that simply don’t care. It’s easy to agree with someone, or let your ideas be discarded when you don’t give a shit about the product. No, I want to work with people that have massive egos WITH the self-awareness to see the truth about themselves and in their work. They do great work by making their egos work for the product. I believe truth seeking is the most important cultural value.
