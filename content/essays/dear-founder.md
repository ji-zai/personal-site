"We ran out of money" = you weren't willing to let go of everyone you hired and weren't willing to upend your life and move to a different region / country with a much lower burn rate.

"The market isn't there yet" = You didn’t care enough about the problem you were solving to stick with it long enough.

"Our investors pressured us to sell" = There was a part of you that wanted to sell. Or, you chose the wrong investors, and you gave up too much control because you craved to grow too fast.

The money, the market, the problem you chose to tackle, the investors, competition, etc. didn't cause your failure. You did.

Failing isn’t bad, but not taking away the right learnings from failures is terrible for your growth as a founder, and as a person.

To learn from a failure, you must fight to get to the truth of what caused that failure. The truth is difficult to see because your ego will do its best to prevent the truth from even entering your conscious mind. It’s a coping mechanism designed to protect your sense of self-worth.

Fight that cope. It’s a bloody war with yourself, but there’s no other way.

It’s a lot easier to say: “the market wasn’t there yet” than:

“I decided to shut down the startup even though I believe there is an opportunity here because I failed to lead the team to build the right product in time, and I didn’t want to go to the middle of nowhere to extend our runway and grind it out with just the cofounders for a few months or years as we patiently pursued this path. I’m attached to my current lifestyle here and I don’t want to change it. I also went on a great date recently that felt promising, I don't want to give up the possibility of being with that person for this company.”

Or even:

“I decided to shut down the company because the market wasn’t there yet. I believe the market will be strong in five years, but I don’t have the patience to wait that long because of my desire to be somebody. I can’t stand the thought of my friends and family thinking I’m a failure for possibly five more years.”

Of course you might not want to be this brutally honest with everyone you come across, but you absolutely need to be this honest with yourself.

Then, even if you decide to shut things down, at least you’ll do it with the right understanding of reality.

And that’s fine! If that’s the choice you made, that’s the choice you made. But you have to see that you made that choice in the first place. Most of the time these choices are made for you in your subconscious by your ego.

By fighting the inner war, you pull these choices from your subconscious into your conscious mind giving you greater control over your destiny.

It’s only when you see, and then accept, what you really are, that you have a chance of changing yourself in the direction you want to change in.

When you own your problems, your mind will naturally try to find solutions.

For example, if your product involves hardware and you don’t have the resources, you’ll ask yourself if you can start with the software aspect of that product and get traction for that first… and you’ll probably see that you can.

If your product requires a lot of compute to, say, train AI models, then you’ll ask yourself if you’ve tried to cold email the tens of thousands of technologists and researchers around the world politely asking to borrow some compute to train your model.

When only 10 people respond to your cold emails declining, you’ll ask yourself how you can pitch yourself better. You’ll work to refine your pitch and reach out again asking for feedback.

Look, I’m not saying there aren’t any valid excuses for factors out of your control. But you should only reach the conclusion that the source of your failure is external after ruthlessly exhausting all possibilities to take full responsibility for your failure. And even then be very cautious... your ego is an expert at tricking you and clouding your view of reality.

As AI and technology mature, you will have greater leverage than you can imagine, and even lesser room for valid excuses. What required teams and years to build will be achievable by an individual in days. You can build great products and generate revenue without raising a dollar. Your team can remain tiny and punch orders of magnitude above its weight.

The only thing stopping you is yourself.

(This essay is directed towards a younger, weaker version of myself that spent too much effort coming up with excuses for his failures, without realizing that his problem - and the solution - was in his own mind).
