Truth seeking ability is the most valuable skill for founders.

Seeking truth enables you to make better decisions, manage stress, be more productive, think longer term, be more ambitious, and therefore succeed in the ways you want to succeed.

Our minds default to telling ourselves lies. These lies feel good in the moment, but they’ll kill your ability to grow as a founder, and as a person.

It's easier to say "the market wasn't there yet", than:

“I decided to shut down the company even though I believe the market will be strong in five years, but I don’t have the patience to wait that long because of my craving to appear successful in the eyes of my family and friends. I can’t stand the thought of everyone thinking I’m a failure for possibly five more years, so I'm going to try to find a product angle that'll generate money quickly.”

It's easier to say "we ran out of money", than:

"We could pull it off if I fire everyone, and the cofounders and I move to more_affordable_place to extend our runway by a couple of years as we patiently grinded it out. But I have friends here. I like my apartment and oh, I just had a date with this really cool person and want to explore a future with them that I believe is more important than this company."

It's easier to say "we didn't find the growth we needed", than:

"I decided to stop working on my company because after spending 2 years on it, I realized it wasn't a problem I cared about deeply. I didn't want to squander a decade of my life working on something I'm not passionate about."

You don't have to be this honest with the people you talk to, but you absolutely must brutally honest with yourself.

It’s only when you see, and accept the truth for what it is, that you can grow yourself in the ways you want to.

### Your delusions

There are two opposing systems operating simultaneously in your mind: what your conscious mind wants, and what your subconscious wants.

For most of us, what our conscious mind wants are quite positive. We want to do good for the world. We want to do what’s best for the company. We want peace and harmony, etc.

But all our subconscious cares about is self-preservation [x], and it aims to achieve this by optimizing for external validation and individual status. It’s hardwired deep into our psyche as part of evolution.

Your conscious mind craves internal consistency. Your subconscious knows this, which is why it needs to hide the truth from your conscious mind. It warps your perception of reality to make your conscious mind believe you’re acting for the company, while deep down in the subconscious layers, you’re actually optimizing for getting your face on the cover of Forbes.

It’s quite easy to spot this inconsistency in others because their subconscious mind can’t warp your perception of them, so you can see how they’re enslaved by their subconscious. But you’re just as inconsistent, delusional and enslaved as you find others to be, if not worse. It’s just incredibly more difficult to see your own delusions.

Your subconscious is waging a full on assault on your conscious mind every single moment. You just don’t see it.

Fight!

Your greatest weapon is seeking truth.

Seeking truth is the process of seeing what’s happening in the subconscious layers of your mind.

It’s like shining a light into your subconscious, bringing some of its activity into your conscious visibility.

When you get a glimpse, you’ll puke. It’ll be disgusting. Atrocious. You’re not what you think you are.

While your conscious mind dreams of fixing education, your subconscious dreams of adding “forbes_x_under_x”, or “some_accelerator” in your Twitter bio.

While your conscious mind dreams of building tools that empower the billions of mobile-first users around the world, your subconscious dreams of being in Lex’s podcast chatting about how you changed the world.

The more you dig, the more crap comes up. Wear a mask if you can. And keep a bucket close by.

You are everything you hate in others, 10x’ed.

Now, you might ask how seeking truth bring you out of your delusions. After all, it’s simply shining a light on it right? It’s not really changing anything.

But it will. On its own.

The beauty of this process is that when you shed light on your subconscious and brought some of it into your conscious visibility, you’ve created an inconsistency in your conscious mind: you thought you were one thing, but the reality you saw in your subconscious has completely shattered that view.

Your mind HATES internal inconsistencies. In a panic it will try to bridge the gap between your desired state and the current quite undesirable state of mind.

This is where your ego actually helps you! [x]

To bridge the inconsistency, your mind can either:

1. Become dejected by realizing that you’re not all that you thought you were and giving up.
2. Force you to rise to become the person you want to be, that you earlier thought you were, but have since realized you are not.

The ego pushes you to take the second path. It pushes you to rise to your ideal self-image.

Yes, it’s shaken. It just went through a traumatic experience. But, your ego still craves to be somebody! And so you’re leveraging the power of your own ego to push you to rise.

Therefore, seeking truth is all you need to do. It kickstarts an automatic internal process that forces you to grow and make decisions that are more aligned with what your conscious mind values, and less hijacked by your subconscious.

### Make better decisions

As you’re less deluded, you’ll naturally make better decisions because your decisions are based in reality.

It might not mean that you’ll do something different than your more deluded, former self all the time, but it does mean that when you do make a decision you’re more aware of why you’re making that decision.

And that makes all the difference because it enables you to take away the right learnings from your mistakes, and also enables you to communicate the truth to others.

Communication is a lossy transmission of information. Even if you see the truth clearly, when you share it with someone else, there is information lost, as well as information warped (by their own delusions that warp their perception of reality).

Which is why at the least starting from a position of greater truth in your own mind allows you to communicate information that is more true so that you can collectively make better decisions.

When you see how deluded your mind is, and the value of truth seeking, you can’t help but only work with people who are great at seeking truth. Otherwise your company will drive itself off the cliff. [x].

But, it’s not enough to just intellectually accept that there’s crap going on in your subconscious. You need to be able to feel that crap when you’re in the moment making decisions. That’s when you’ll know when to pause and reflect rather than continue in a hurry.

You need to be able to notice that subtle rush of power coursing through your body as you’re typing that email to approve expanding your company to a new country. That’s your subconscious manifesting its crap to you. It’s right there to be seen, you just have to pay attention.

When you notice it, pause and reflect rather than continue in a hurry. Your subconscious will make it tough to stop and reflect by releasing hormones that make you feel strong and powerful, like you’re on the top of the world. Reign it the fuck in buddy.

Perhaps the way to understand the truth in your mind is unique to each individual, but whatever the process is, giving yourself more time helps.

Which is why when you’re making high impact decisions, sit for a bit and try to better understand the truth motivating you to take a particular path before making it. Perhaps get feedback from others [x] who may be able to see certain aspects of reality better if they have less to gain personally from that decision.

You might be wondering why when I’ve been talking about seeking truth, I’ve only been talking about understanding the internal truths in your subconscious mind and not about seeking truth in the external world. After all, for your startup to succeed, you need to build a product that is aligned with the reality of the external world.

Our delusions about the external world stem from our internal delusions.

When you remove self-delusions, you’ll be able to perceive external realities much more clearly.

Our subconscious prevents us from seeing solutions that it thinks are too painful and difficult since it cares about self-preservation. Therefore your subconscious will prevent you from seeing the right solution to a problem if it’s a painful one.

Yet, oftentimes the right solution to a problem is also the most painful one.

This is why products, codebases, design systems, documentation, etc. get bloated and grow in complexity over time. It’s more painful to cut than it is to add. It’s more painful to take a step back without attachment and revisit how to do things from first principles than it is to just slap on the next thing. A deluded mind can’t see solutions that involve tossing aside a feature that took a lot of effort to create.

### Be more ambitious

In the same way you can’t even see the right decisions to make for your product, you won’t even be able to see ambitious paths to take in life because of how difficult they are.

Paul Graham calls this schlep blindness. 

> How do you overcome schlep blindness? Frankly, the most valuable antidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance. Most successful founders would probably say that if they'd known when they were starting their company about the obstacles they'd have to overcome, they might never have started it. Maybe that's one reason the most successful startups of all so often have young founders.
> 

> In practice the founders grow with the problems. But no one seems able to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders. So the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they make two mistakes that cancel each other out. They don't know how much they can grow, but they also don't know how much they'll need to. Older founders only make the first mistake.
> 

> Ignorance can't solve everything though. Some ideas so obviously entail alarming schleps that anyone can see them. How do you see ideas like that? The trick I recommend is to take yourself out of the picture. Instead of asking "what problem should I solve?" ask "what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?" If someone who had to process payments before Stripe had tried asking that, Stripe would have been one of the first things they wished for.

When you shed light on your subconscious cravings for immediate status gratification, it starts to lose its power. When it loses its power, you’re more able to see important problems in the world that might take decades, or even centuries to tackle well, because you’re no longer enslaved by short-term thinking.

### Manage stress better

Accepting the truth relaxes the mind after the initial chaos and anxiety.

### Be more productive

You'll also be far more productive.

When you're brutally honest with yourself, you'll realize that you yourself are the root cause of all of your problems and you'll begin to take more ownership.

When you take more ownership, your mind will naturally try to find solutions to your problems because it believes you have control.

For example, when your product involves hardware and you don’t have the resources to manufacture it, you’ll ask yourself if you can start with the software aspect of that product and get traction for that first… and you’ll probably see that you can.

If your product requires a lot of compute to, say, train AI models, then you’ll ask yourself who you could donate some resources to you, leading you to cold email hundreds of technologists and researchers around the world politely asking to borrow some compute to train your model... and you'll see that they'll help.

There's always a way. It's only a question of whether you genuinely want it, or just want to want it.

### So, how do you seek internal truth?

I’m not sure about the exact way (because I do think each individual is unique in how they’re able to seek truth about themselves), but I’m more confident t

No matter how much external input / feedback you receive, the real work happens in your own mind.

I believe it’s invaluable to set aside all mental consumption, and sit silently, ideally with eyes closed to remove even visual stimuli, and simply sit and observe whatever’s happening inside.

Some call this meditation, but I think that’s too loaded of a term, that has too many different meanings and interpretations to be useful. What you call this process doesn’t matter, but the purpose ought to be clear: to see what the fuck is actually happening inside and driving your decisions.

I don’t think 5 - 10, or even 30 minutes are enough to be able to see internal truths for most of us. You’ll need to be able to observe your mind long enough to see its true habits unfold, to start to see the junk rise from the subconscious.

- Put the body in relative ease. I’m not talking about getting physically fit, though that could help. There are plenty of chubby people, who don’t work out, who have trained their minds to seek truth effectively.
    - When your body is tense, your subconscious is better at guarding its secrets because it’s operating in flight or fight.
- This could be going for a long walk in nature.
- You might already by doing these things, but I hope when you realize the value of seeking truth, you not only prioritize this more, but also be more intentional about actually seeking truth rather than use it to consume more information (podcast, etc.) that doesn’t give your subconscious the space to unravel.

### Conclusion

As AI and technology mature, you will have greater leverage than you can imagine, and even fewer valid excuses. What required large teams and years to build will be achievable by an individual in days. You can build great products and generate revenue without raising a dollar. A tiny team can punch orders of magnitude above its weight. You can reach most individuals in the world through the internet.

- Rapid rate of change ⇒ more anxiety, and fears about our value in the world (all stemming from the subconscious).
- 

The only thing stopping you is yourself.

[x] This is why I’m not a fan team cultures that emphasize “low egos”. I often find these teams full of people that simply don’t care. It’s easy to agree with someone, or let your ideas be discarded when you don’t give a shit about the product. No, I want to work with people that have massive egos WITH the self-awareness to see the truth about themselves and in their work. They do great work by making their egos work for the product. I believe truth seeking is the most important cultural value.

[x] (Something about how people say “Be more ambitious”, but they don’t really tell you how. It’s kind of silly).

[x] I don’t think committee based decision making works well, except in certain extreme scenarios. So here I’m talking about feedback without necessarily increasing the number of decision makers.

[x] Collective delusion is the primary cause for companies driving themselves off the cliff. And it looks ridiculous from the outside, like how could IBM not see the importance of home computers, or Japanese hardware companies see the shift in power to software, or Google see the importance of shipping actual AI products before some tiny, significantly less funded startup. But, it’s easy to point fingers at these companies until you run one off the cliff just like them. Curb that delusion my friend, or the world will humble you real fast.
