Lack of money, the market, the problem you chose to tackle, your investors, competition, etc. didn't cause you to fail. Only you caused you to fail.

Failing isn’t bad, but not taking away the right learnings from failures is terrible for your growth as a founder, and as a person.

To learn from a failure, you must get to the truth behind why you failed. The truth is difficult to see because your ego will do its best to prevent the truth from even entering your conscious mind. It’s a coping mechanism designed to protect your sense of self-worth.

Fight that cope.

Through this inner war with your ego to see the truth, you pull your subconscious decisions into your conscious mind, giving you greater control over your destiny.

It’s only when you see, and accept, the truth, that you have a chance of making changes in the direction you want to change in. You'll be far more productive.

It's easier to say "the market wasn't there yet", than:

“I decided to shut down the company even though I believe the market will be strong in five years, but I don’t have the patience to wait that long because of my craving to appear successful in the eyes of my family and friends. I can’t stand the thought of everyone thinking I’m a failure for possibly five more years, so I'm going to try to find a product angle that'll generate money quickly.”

It's easier to say "we ran out of money", than:

"I believe we could pull it off if I fired everyone, and the cofounders and I move to {more_affordable_place} to extend our runway by a couple of years as we patiently grinded it out. But I have friends here. I like my apartment and oh, I just had a date with this really cool person and want to explore a future with them that I believe is more important than this company."

It's easier to say "we didn't find the growth we needed", than:

"I decided to stop working on my company because after spending 2 years on it, I realized it wasn't a problem I cared about deeply. I didn't want to squander a decade of my life working on something I'm not passionate about."

It's easier to say "our competition raised way more money than we did", than:

"I hired incompetent people because I wanted to grow faster so that I could tell my friends and parents that I'm the boss of a company with 100 employees. But then the first few incompetent hires hired more incompetent people leading to an incompetent company. We couldn't ship shit. I can't fire half the team now and then spend time hiring more competent people because then I'll look like an asshole and also incompetent for hiring terribly. So I'm going to accept defeat, shut down the company and blame it on competition in order to protect my reputation."

You don't have to be this brutally honest with the people you talk to, but you absolutely must to be this honest with yourself.

As long as your decisions are rooted in reality, it's OK if you decide to, say, shut down your company! If that’s the choice you made, that’s the choice you made. But you have to see that you made that choice in the first place. Most of the time, your ego makes decisions for you in your subconscious to protect you from the pain of the truth.

You'll realize that when you're fully honest, you can't help but take the decision that allows you to respect yourself more. Ha! You're now using your ego to protect you from your ego. Touche.

When you're brutally honest with yourself, you'll realize that you're the root cause of all of your problems, and you'll begin to take more ownership.

When you take more ownership, your mind will naturally try to find solutions to your problems because it believes you have control. You'll be far more productive.

For example, when your product involves hardware and you don’t have the resources to manufacture it, you’ll ask yourself if you can start with the software aspect of that product and get traction for that first… and you’ll probably see that you can.

If your product requires a lot of compute to, say, train AI models, then you’ll ask yourself who you could donate some resources to you, leading you to cold email hundreds of technologists and researchers around the world politely asking to borrow some compute to train your model... and you'll see that they'll help.

There's always a way. It's only a question of whether you genuinely want it, or just want to want it.

Look, I’m not saying there aren’t factors out of your control. But you should only reach the conclusion that the source of your failure is external after ruthlessly exhausting all possibilities to take full responsibility for your actions. And even then, be extremely cautious... your ego is an expert at tricking you and clouding your view of reality. After all, its spent its entire existence learning how to manipulate you.

As AI and technology mature, you will have greater leverage than you can imagine, and even fewer valid excuses. What required large teams and years to build will be achievable by an individual in days. You can build great products and generate revenue without raising a dollar. Your team can remain tiny and punch orders of magnitude above its weight.

The only thing stopping you is yourself.

(This essay is directed towards a younger, weaker version of myself that spent too much effort coming up with excuses for his failures, without realizing that his problem - and solution - was in his own mind).
