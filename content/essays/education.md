title: Paying for education is a trap
date: May 2024

Paying to learn won't work for most because the gap in productivity between the best and the average is growing quickly, leading to a world in which if you’re not one of the best at something the world values, you will not be able to contribute to the economy.

In such a world, most people who pay for education will not be able to recuperate their investment. Paying for education will not work.

Those with the potential to be one of the best will sell equity in themselves in exchange for capital, resources and mentorship. Investing in individuals is the only viable business model for education in a winners-take-most world.

Of course, there’s no limit to the kinds of activities we will have. The global economy is positive-sum. But, within each domain the best will capture most of the value, leaving little room for the average. This shift is inevitable. It’s caused by progress. When we invent better technology or improve human rights, the gap between the best and the rest grows. You’ll increasingly need to be one of the best at what you do to make a living.

Variance in ability is a byproduct of complexity. The complexity of an activity is proportional to the number of possibilities. A more complex activity has more possible paths you can take, and thus more decisions and more choices.

The more complex an activity is, the more variance we see in ability for that activity - regardless of training.

No matter how much training startup founders / creators have, there is bound to be large variance in their ability due to the inherent complexity of the skill itself.

For simpler skills, training works more predictably. The best factory worker is only moderately more productive than the average one. But, the best startup founder is orders of magnitude more productive than the average. The average founder fails, while the best achieves unfathomable outcomes.

Even if the best entrepreneur or artist coached students 24/7 for a decade, we would still see great variance in ability. Some would be far better than others.

If we could plot the ability of professionals on a graph, we’d notice a power law distribution. The more complex the activity, the power law is more extreme. The gap in ability between the best creator and the next best is much larger than the gap between the best factory worker and the next best. By many orders of magnitude.

Our world is rapidly becoming more complex, leading to far greater variance in ability.

Greater leverage makes our activities more complex by letting us skip simpler activities and by making complex activities even more complex. Leverage is how little time it takes to implement an idea. The more leverage you have, the less time it takes to manifest your ideas.

Before computers, we spent a lot of time crunching numbers. As we gained better technology, we could spend more time figuring out what to create and how - which are much more complex than crunching numbers.

Greater leverage makes what was once impossible possible, increasing the complexity of an activity. Building software got much more complex when the world adopted smartphones because there were many more possibilities in what you could build and who you could build for.

Our minds don't dream of ideas it believes are impossible to implement. More leverage boosts our confidence, letting us dream wider and bigger which also increases complexity of our activities.

Greater leverage increases the rate at which we make decisions, leading to more decisions. Each decision we make has a greater impact on results because there is more compounding: more decisions made on top of a decision.

Thus, as leverage improves, small differences in ability lead to larger differences in productivity.
  
The gap in productivity between the best software engineers and the average has gone up significantly after GPT-4 because the complexity of engineering has greatly increased. There are more possible ways to engineer systems and the best ways are now much better than what they were earlier. Thus, the best engineers are much better than the average. Every jump in AI will push the best even further ahead.

Leverage is improving exponentially fast. The gap in productivity between the best and the rest is rising rapidly in tandem, accelerating us towards a “winners-take-most” world.

It’s tempting to believe that even when the gap and productivity between the best and the rest rises, the average can still create value. They might, but what they will earn will be far less than what they did when the best weren’t as good. Eventually no one who’s average will be able to make a living.

When the best are thousands or even hundreds of thousands of times better than the average, it becomes difficult to justify hiring someone who’s average. Hiring 1000 average people to replace someone who’s great at what they do doesn’t work because the communication overhead of managing such a large team makes them far less productive than the great individual, or team of greats.

Most people who are average will not become one of the best because the activity itself is far more complex leading to more variance in ability. Eventually, only those with an innate natural advantage who work hard to amplify their advantage will be the only ones who can create value in any domain. The rest will have to change what they do. They can’t compete.

Any institution that charges money for education will face pressure from both ends:

1. More graduates will fail to get hired due to the inherent power law in productivity for complex skills, making paying for education more risky.
2. The cost of a quality teacher increases because fewer individuals will have the required skill to teach. Those who can will be more expensive than ever before because they will increasingly need to be one of the best at what they do for their teaching to be good enough.
    

Most bootcamps, paid online courses, and colleges will die or become irrelevant. They will not scale beyond a niche audience: those who don’t need a return on investment. The top colleges will linger around for a while because we are slow to update our craving for outdated prestige.

“Free” education that someone else pays for (taxpayers) also won’t work because they won’t have the success rate required to sustain them. 

Leverage grows at different rates. We will see paying for education fail for software engineering much sooner than for manufacturing related skills. Paying for education will continue to work for simpler skills for a while longer. But training yourself for a simpler skill is dangerous because sooner or later all domains will become very complex. And skill in simpler activities doesn’t translate to more complex ones. It’s better to embrace the challenge than to shy away from it.

The only education business model that works in a winners-take-most world is one in which individuals can trade equity in themselves for resources.

With this shift in the business model, the highest potential prospective students will avoid even the top colleges because they will find much more efficient ways to discover and collaborate with other ambitious, smart people. And they will have the capital to do so.

The best knowledge will be available for free because it will come from those who are one of the best, who will have other means of wealth that far surpasses anything they’d get from charging for their knowledge.

The best personalized feedback will be available for equity. The best would only invest time into someone if they have potential. The best will also be incentivized to help train AI to scale personalized feedback because it will increase the pool of people they can invest in.

Paying for education is a trap. It doesn’t have the same value as it did in a far less complex world in which you could predictably train yourself to be one of the best. We are at the start of a big change in how the world will be educated. And it will start with a fundamental shift in the business model of education.
