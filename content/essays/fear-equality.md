- A small percentage of decisions lead most results.
- A small percentage of creators capture most engagement.
- A small percentage of books capture most of sales.
- A small percentage of individuals hold most of the wealth.
- A small percentage of employees in a company are responsible for the majority of output.
- A small percentage of companies capture most of the market.

The world is quite asymmetric.

Asymmetry is accelerating rapidly and it cannot be stopped because it's a byproduct of human progress. Every single thing we do - whether we build technology, shape culture through art, fight for human rights - makes the world more asymmetric.

The more asymmetric the world becomes, the more counterintuitive it is to act optimally to get what we want because our habits become more outdated. Rapidly.

A leader of a company who believes they have equally great employees will fail. A prospective employee that joins a company with a great team in which there isn't a large difference between the best and the worst will join a company that will quickly perish. A prospective student who joins an institution that claims to have great outcomes for most of their graduates will receive a terribly outdated education.

This is because as asymmetry rises, the best teams will look more unequal than ever before. The gap between the best performer and the next best performer will be much greater than ever before. Similarly the gap between the 2nd best and the 3rd best will be much greater than the 4th and 5th. You will only see more equality in ability as you tend towards the mediocre.

Therefore someone joining a team that isn't extremely asymmetric are, whether they acknowledge it or not, joining mediocre teams.

The rate of change is accelerating. There will no longer be stagnation of any sort, only accelerated growth or accelerated death. Mediocre teams & companies will become irrelevant shockingly fast. Therefore a slight miscalculation that leads you to joining a mediocre team, or joining an institution that trains you to join mediocre teams, will be more costly than ever before. The type of skill and training that leads to mediocrity does not translate to becoming great at what you do. You will feel a painful crunch if you remain mediocre during this shift. Most of us are mediocre. I certainly am.

The world will increasingly not have any room for the average in any domain. The average will either have to become incredibly good at what they do, find another domain where they can be great, or create a new game that people value in which they can be great. There will be no "middle class" in any domain, i.e. no group of similarly performing individuals, because such groups will not be able to compete with the best who will be much, much better than before.

All of us will make great miscalculations in getting what we want because even if we understand the growing asymmetry in the world, we lack the appropriate intuition for it. Our failures will stem from our craving for equality, and our solution comes from turning that craving into fear of equality. Habits are tough to break as they are. Turning a craving into a fear is an even greater challenge. Yet, we have no choice.

My purpose is to identify what the optimal path looks like today, how it will change, and develop heuristics to help myself adapt to our rapidly changing world. In order to understand what the optimal path looks like, we need to first understand what causes asymmetry and how it's changing.

...

Asymmetry is a function of complexity. The greater the complexity, the greater the asymmetry.

In games, complexity corresponds to the number of possibilities within the game. A simpler game has fewer possibilities, while a more complex game has many more possibilities.

Most human endeavors can be modeled as a games: "success" is the satiation we feel from getting what we want, and we explore to get what we want by making choices (making "moves" in the game). Therefore we can study asymmetry in simpler games and extrapolate our learnings to the more complex games we play.

Let's take three games: [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) (simple), [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) (medium complexity), [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) (high complexity). (If you're not familiar with these games, please read a bit about them before proceeding).

Tic Tac Toe is simpler than Chess because there are less possibilities of the game because there are much fewer board positions you can end up at. Similarly Chess is less complex than Go because there are fewer board positions that are possible in the game, meaning less overall possibilities.

We can observe asymmetry in these games in two ways: 
1. Asymmetry in the moves to make
2. Asymmetry in the outcomes of players

Some moves are obviously better than others, meaning there's a notion of "value" such that the higher the value of a move, the better it is: the more it corresponds with winning (getting what you want).

The greater the asymmetry in moves, the less equal the values of the moves are. In a simple game like Tic Tac Toe, in a competition between two trained players, all moves are valued equally because a draw can always be forced. In a game of Chess (medium complexity), from any given position of the board, there are a range of values for the moves you can make. There are better and worse moves, and there is some difference between the best move and the next best move. In Go, similar to Chess, there are better and worse moves, but the gap between the best move and the next best move is greater than it is in Chess because Go is a more complex game.

Greater asymmetry in moves leads to greater asymmetry of outcomes. We can observe this by seeing the ELO ratings of professionals for these games. "ELO rating" is a way to calculate relative skills of players:

> The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system))

It's important to note that the difference in ELO rating doesn't translate linearly to the difference in wins. Someone who is a few hundred ELO rating higher than another will almost certainly win.

In Go, the difference in ELO rating of the top two players is 183 ([https://www.goratings.org/en/](https://www.goratings.org/en/)), whereas in Chess, the difference in ELO rating of the top two Chess players is only 25 ([https://www.chess.com/players](https://www.chess.com/players)).

The gap between the best and the next best is greater in Go than in Chess. Meanwhile there's no need for ELO rating for Tic Tac Toe because every "professional" would draw, meaning everyone's ELO would be zero. Similarly, the gap between the 2nd best and 3rd best is greater the more complex a game is. We observe this in the ELO ratings of professionals in Chess and Go. The more complex the game, the greater the difference in outcome of the nth and the (n+1)th player. 

Asymmetry is not linear. The gap between the best player and the 2nd best player is larger than the gap between the 2nd best player and the 3rd best, and so on. The greater the complexity of the game, the greater the gap between the best and the rest, and the more skewed the curve looks.

Lastly, we should notice that the more complex the game becomes, outcomes (i.e. ELO ratings) become more equal the further you go towards worse players. ***In other words, the more complex the game, the more likely that when two players are equally good it means that they're farther in ability from the best.***

The games we play today to get the things we want are of much, much higher in complexity than the games we discussed above, leading to far greater asymmetry in the actions we take, and in our outcomes.

But, if the games we play have always been more complex than the board games we discussed, then why haven't we always seen a great deal of asymmetry in the world, and importantly, why is it increasing?

That's because the complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. By leverage I mean: how little time it takes to turn an idea into reality. The greater the leverage available to you, the less time it takes you to turn your ideas into reality.

Human progress increases leverage, and spreads it to more people. For example, when a dictatorship is replaced by a democracy, the citizens gain leverage because they are more free and therefore can manifest their ideas that they previously couldn't. When a new technology is created, it reduces the time it takes to turn your idea into reality, thereby increasing leverage.

Computers, internet, artificial intelligence, government policies, greater individual freedom, etc. all work to increase leverage in the world.

Greater leverage increases the complexity of the games we play in three ways:
1. By reducing the time per move.
2. By eliminating the need to play simpler games (because technology does it for us).
3. By increasing the possibilities within any game, thereby making the game itself more complex.

When it takes a long time to make a move, the underlying asymmetry doesn't manifest quickly. Imagine a game of chess where each move took 5 years to make. By the time the players die, their differences wouldn't be that apparent. It's not that the asymmetry wasn't there, but that it didn't have enough time to present itself.  Over the past decade technology has drastically reduced the time it takes to turn an idea into reality - i.e. the time it takes to make a move, and therefore the underlying asymmetries manifest themselves faster.

As leverage increases, we stop playing simpler games. Before we had computers, a large amount of time and effort was involved in keep track of numbers and basic numerical calculations. As we gained better technology, we were able to shift more of our time to playing more complex games: figuring out what to create and how to create it.

And lastly, games that were always complex become even more complex due to leverage. Our subconscious is limited by the leverage we have available to us. Our minds don't like to dream about things that it believes are impossible. Most filmmakers a century ago likely wouldn't have dreamt of making a film about intergalactic politics, and constrained their ideas to films that could take place in the normal world. As leverage increased, filmmakers were able to dream bigger and wider. Their minds opened up to more possibilities within the same game, making the game itself more complex.

I made a claim earlier that the games we play are far more complex than Chess and Go. A good reader would have been annoyed that I offered no explanation. Even though my intuition led me to write that claim quickly (and I suspect some readers would have a similar intuition), the explanation wasn't as straightforward as I initially felt it would be.

There is a hierarchy of complexity for human endeavors. The most complex human activities are the ones in which success is measured by how good you make people feel.

And the representational complexity of feeling is far greater than that of Chess or Go. By representational complexity I mean how easy it is to describe the state of the game at any moment in time. A game that has a much more complicated state, likely has many more possibilities for what moves you can take, and is therefore more complex in general.

To see why, recall when you had to communicate how you felt. You'll remember how difficult it is to do so, and importantly that no matter how many words you use, you weren't able to fully, completely, represent your feeling in words. This is because a feeling has a much higher representational complexity than words. Trying to represent a feeling in words is difficult because we are trying to represent something of a higher complexity into a medium that has less complexity. Information is bound to be lost in that translation.

This lost information is precisely what allows for the various interpretations of words. Every single person reading this essay will have different feelings as they read this. Even though my intention is to make you feel what I feel about this topic, there is absolutely no way for me to do so without any loss of information, no matter what medium I use: words, images, videos, symbols, anything - even if I spend my entire life trying. I believe this gap between feeling and how well we can communicate it is quite large. <FootnoteReference number={3} />

The representational complexity of Chess and Go can easily be represented by symbols (text, pictures, etc.), and therefore I believe that any game in which success is measured by how good you make people feel will be orders of magnitude more complex than Chess and Go (proportional to the difference in complexity between feeling and a sequence of symbols).  The underlying asymmetry that we are moving towards is quite extreme because we are moving towards "feeling games".

A couple of centuries ago, most workers spent their time playing games that had nothing to do with how to make someone feel. For example, they may assemble physical things in a factory and success was measured by how well and fast you could put together multiple parts of a product. As that region progressed, they built better technology, and offshored simpler work to other places, leaving workers to move up complexity towards services such as marketing, support, design, etc, which are closer to solving for how to make people feel good.

We notice this trend today as well. Programmers are being asked to become better at thinking about what to build and understanding users, [without just thinking about how to build something](https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1637087219591659520). Animators are being asked to contribute something meaningful to the story instead of only translating a rough sketch into a completed animation. Pizza cooks, and ice cream store employees, are all being asked to tell engaging stories on social media to attract more customers. 

***Everyone is moving towards figuring out how to make people feel.***

Artists for thousands of years have been solving for how to make people feel. Which is why it's no surprise that the arts have always had extreme asymmetry. Human progress is pushing us all towards the games that artists have been playing for a long time, and also towards the intense asymmetry that artists have felt for a long time.

We can't be satisfied with any conclusions about asymmetry without also considering the role of fairness. The real world is not like a board game. Life's not fair.

Let's imagine a fairy tale world in which every child has loving, caring, supportive parents, the best teachers, and the freedom to explore what they want. Let's say no one is concerned about how to make a living, and everyone has access to great healthcare, a fast fair legal system, etc. And that everyone has very high leverage: anything we imagine can be manifested into reality much more quickly than today.

Have an idea for an app? It'll be manifested in a day. The same for a video, song, etc. If you can imagine an idea and express well enough through some mediums (language, drawing, etc.), then something will turn it into reality quite quickly. In this world, all you will care about is to create things that you want - whether that's art, better tools, physical things, etc.

What do you think the outcomes of this imaginary world would look like?

I believe it would be incredibly asymmetric. The richest person in this imaginary world will be so stupidly rich that it's unfathomable to us right now. And that there would be great variance in outcomes across the board.

I believe this because in a highly leveraged world, we have more possibilities and we make moves much quicker. Therefore, slight differences in choices at the start of the game would lead to drastic differences by the time we die due to the complexity of the game.

And not all explorations are equally worthwhile. Someone who spends their entire life learning how to craft the best baskets to sell to their village will not have the same outcomes as someone who explored building software products for a large audience. <FootnoteReference number={4} />

Being influenced slightly differently early on, which leads to a slightly different choices will have incredibly large difference in where you end up. The greater the leverage, the greater the difference because the faster you make your moves, and the deeper in the game you go because you make many more moves before you die.

Two twins that open up a social app and see two different videos are in influenced in subtly different ways. Each slightly different choice compounds greatly and they will end up in very different places in their exploration of life. The greater the leverage in the world, the more pronounced the difference in how they explore life. 

***Twins born a century ago, on average, would have ended life with a less different exploration than twins today.***

And this isn't even taking into account the difference in our abilities at birth! If we include that, then asymmetry would be even greater. I think it's silly to think that we're not born with different capabilities, different strengths and weaknesses, different emotional reactions to the same stimuli. Nature is an incredibly complex system - possibly more complex than our feelings. Expecting it to produce two equal things of anything is a delusion.

Therefore, in a fair, leveraged world in which our activities are complex, we would see extreme asymmetry.

---

Unfairness can also cause inequality. But the shape of the inequality caused by unfairness is fundamentally different than the shape of the inequality caused by a fair, leveraged world. Being able to differentiate between them is an important skill that, as we'll see later, will help us navigate an asymmetric world.

Equality that stems from unfairness is different in that there are more rigid boundaries between classes, and it's more difficult to move from one class to another. Hierarchical caste systems that tell you what you can and cannot do with your life, that you have different rights and potentials than other casts, are incredibly unfair. Even in the industrial revolution, there was a large, rigid divide between workers and those that were able to afford to build factories - quite unfair, but less unfair than the caste systems that gave you absolutely no way to rise. There were at least a dozen factory workers across the entire industrial revolution that were able to start their own factories at some point. The same can't be said about someone born as an "untouchable" who wanted to, say, learn how to read and write.

The graph of outcomes in an unfair world looks like a step function. You will find different classes, and you'll see that there aren't any individuals with outcomes in between the outcomes of the two classes. In other words, all factory workers would make roughly equal outcomes, whereas all factory owners would make roughly equal outcomes, but you'd find very few in between the workers and the owners. This is a symptom of unfairness.

Inequality that stems from a complex world with fairness and leverage is a smoother curve: you will find individuals at all sorts of different outcomes. We can see this in the outcomes for our board game examples: though the difference between the best and the rest is large, if you plotted everyone on a graph, it would be a much smoother curve than the one you would see if you plotted all outcomes in the industrial revolution.

When you look at those curves closely, you'll notice something interesting: the more unfair curves are also more "equal" because they have more people that are making roughly the same, but just divided by classes. Whereas the inequality from fairness and leverage is far less equal because it's tougher to find even a few individuals with the same outcome.

***Therefore, counterintuitively, the way to sniff out unfairness is to see how much equality exists in the outcomes***. The more equality that exists (i.e. the more it looks like a step function), the more cautious we ought to be. And complete equality (like the outcomes of Tic Tac Toe) is fair, but terrible, because it means our activities are not complex enough. It would be fair in that we'd all be equally terrible at life. But what you'll see in any unfair system is that there will always be someone who sits a step above a group of others, who, within their group, have equal outcomes.

There is a lot of unfairness in the world today because there is still too much equality. But it is much better than ever before. Our curve of outcomes is smoother than ever before in modern history.

The idea that a fair world would be equal is delusional. A more fair, more leveraged world will be more unequal in outcomes, because the underlying exploration of life will be more varied. And the inequality that stems from unfairness is actually more equal than the inequality that stems from fairness & leverage.

Human progress makes the world more fair by increasing leverage and spreading it wider.

Today, even in many of the poorest communities around the world, many kids have the ability to create, to speak their minds in ways their grandparents couldn't dream of, and have access to information and knowledge through the internet that is barely less than the richest kid living in a Manhattan high rise.

Yet, it's undeniable that the rich child that has access to higher quality, personalized, feedback, more competent, ambitious peers, a stronger safety net, and more supportive loving parents, has an unfair advantage. We have a lot of work to do to make the world fair. And we ought to fight hard for that fairness, but not by pulling down the rich kid's experience, but by making it accessible to all.

Asymmetry is a function of complexity. The greater the complexity of a game, the greater the asymmetry within the game and for the outcomes of the game.

The complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. As leverage increases our activities become more complex.

Leverage is a function of human progress. Every advancement: technology, human rights, medicine, policy, etc. pushes us towards a more leveraged and fair world.

Therefore, asymmetry is rising due to progress.

---

But, asymmetry isn't increasing linearly, but rather it's accelerating exponentially. Therefore the complexity of our activities rises exponentially, and so does asymmetry.

Global GDP is a rough, but directionally correct, approximation of the leverage in the world. The more leverage that exists in the world means that we are able to turn more ideas into reality, creating and selling more things of higher value.

It's only a rough approximation because it only represents the transactions between us that involve a monetary exchange. There are many transactions that increase due to leverage that aren't yet directly captured by an exchange of money, such as liking posts on social media.

GDP is also a lagging indicator of leverage because it takes time to turn leverage into transactions because even though the time it takes to turn an idea to reality decreases, it's still not instantaneous. Only implemented ideas have an opportunity to impact GDP, so we will see today what today's leverage is after some time, once people have applied today's leverage to create value in the world.

Therefore, leverage is accelerating exponentially because global GDP is accelerating exponentially: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run.

Due to this acceleration, we are likely to see much greater asymmetry in the next few years that is proportional to the rise in asymmetry over the past century, if not more.

---

Intellectual understanding of how asymmetry is rising is not enough to act optimally.

We have two fundamental problems holding us back from acting optimally which both stem from the limitations of our minds.

Our first problem is that we do not have an intuitive grasp of exponential change. Even if you intellectually see the current asymmetry of the world and how it's increasing rapidly, you will certainly be surprised and caught off guard. We don't have to look far back to see why. Before the COVID-19 pandemic took off, many nations and institutions had the math right: they could all see the rapid spread of the virus. Heck, even I read an essay in February 2020 that predicted that we'd have a global pandemic. Yet, few, if any, of us had the appropriate emotional response. We lacked the appropriate fear and caution that would have enabled us to take the optimal path to preventing the pandemic.

Similarly, even if you believe everything you've read in this essay so far, I assure you that we'll all be very surprised as we see asymmetry skyrocket on an exponential curve. And if you want to act optimally today, you're going to look stupid and be laughed at by the world in the same way that anyone who wore a mask in January 2020 would have been. Interestingly, you would have also been ridiculed later in the pandemic because you would have stopped masking and taking precautions before most others did, and would have been hated for "putting lives at risk".

Since we all suck at responding optimally to exponential change, you will always look weird and stupid for acting optimally.

Any change you make in your life that is directionally correct will almost certainly not be a strong enough change. In the COVID analogy, if you believed the math that predicted it, even though the optimal strategy in Jan 2020 was to mask up, you would have just washed you hands an extra time thinking it's enough. This is because even though we understand it something intellectually, we don't have the appropriate fear (that manifests as caution) towards it.

Our second problem is that we don't have even a directionally correct emotional response to equality (symmetry). ***Instead of fearing equality as we should, we crave it.***

This makes shifting our behaviors to act optimally even more difficult than it would have been to act optimally towards a viral pandemic because we don't crave a pandemic (except maybe psychos), as we crave equality. Undoing craving and cultivating fear is more difficult than just cultivating fear. And it's not twice as difficult, it's orders of magnitude more difficult because overcoming craving is far more difficult than cultivating fear.

Our craving for equality blinds us to reality. The more disconnected our beliefs are from reality, the more we suffer. And reality is slipping away from us quickly. Through the following examples I hope to show you how our intuitions are outdated.

---

To illustrate how our intuitions fail us, let's study a young person (Joe) in today's world looking to build a great life. I'm making a few assumptions about this young person that I believe represent(s/ed) most of us:
1. They want the world to value them and what they bring to the world.
2. They're not yet sure what they're great at, that the world also values (and will continue to value once they become great at it).
3. They want things that require money to have (home, high quality healthcare, entertainment, family, etc.). Therefore they want to make good money.

Joe does not correctly understand asymmetry and how it's changing.

Each blunder Joe makes is costlier than ever before as it compounds more quickly than ever before. The following are blunders that Joe will make which causes him to suffer more than a similarly skilled person a few years ago.

***1st blunder: what to learn***

Joe will be lured into learning less complex skills that will be quickly outdated as leverage rapidly increases the complexity of the games we play. Instead of building his intuition for solving for peoples' feelings, Joe will learn skills that are more disconnected from feeling.

He will waste too much time learning programming frameworks, design tools, etc. without spending enough time studying the problems people have and how to solve them, or studying what makes people have meaningful experiences and how to provide them.

***2nd blunder: how to learn***

Joe's second blunder will be in how he goes about learning what he thinks is useful.

He will be lured in by colleges, bootcamps, etc. that claim that a high percentage of graduates get great job offers upon graduating. They claim "average $100k salary!". Basing an learning path decision off of the average salary is a massive blunder because what matters much more than the average is the distribution of outcomes, and what the highest outcome is. 

If this learning program does not have massive outliers, it is an outdated learning program given the leverage that exists in the world today because it means that they are teaching skills that are not complex enough, and therefore will not matter as leverage increases, or that the companies hiring these graduates are mediocre, will perish soon, leaving Joe with mediocre skills that won't translate to being great.

The ideal learning program in today's world that will best prepare a student for the future will have extremely asymmetric outcomes. Of course, there is a gap between ability and actual outcome: even though the best software engineer who can correctly leverage AI is likely at least 100x more productive than the average today, they will not get paid that much more. But, as the world becomes more fair and people are compensated more accurately, and mediocre companies perish, the best outcome will become a more reliable metric to gauge how good a teaching program is.

In addition to joining the wrong institution, Joe will likely take out loans or spend hard earned money to join such institutions. Paying money for education works in a more symmetrical outcomes world. Today, if the education is optimal, it means the outcomes will be quite asymmetrical, and therefore Joe will almost certainly not get the return on his investment. Pay-to-learn is an outdated education business model in an asymmetric world.

***3rd blunder: choice in team***

Joe will be lured by teams that claim that everyone on the team is great. Given the leverage that exists in the world today, the best team will be far from having equally good members. If they're equally good it means they haven't upgraded their activities to be more complex, or they haven't upgraded their skills to optimally make use of the greater leverage, or they're terrible at assessing true productivity.

Of course even the best teams will tell the world that everyone on the team is great, because it's not yet culturally acceptable to tell the truth. Joe will blunder again by not realizing that no matter what the team says it's his responsibility to uncover the truth as it's critical information for his decision.

There is one exception for when an equally excellent team exists: when each person is doing a different, but similarly complex, activity. For example: a startup with an engineer, designer, and product / sales person. But even in this scenario it's not that they have equal outcomes, it's just more difficult to measure and compare how each is performing relative to the other. You can't find this exception in larger teams because we don't yet have sufficient leverage in the world to have, say, a single engineer running everything. Therefore as soon as you have a team of the same skill, you should certainly notice asymmetry in outcomes if they're a great team.

Joe will also blunder by thinking that a company that is valued highly today is a great company to join without studying whether they are set up for success in a rapidly shifting world. He won't realize that stagnation is an illusion in a rapidly changing world: there is only accelerated growth or accelerated death. Companies valued highly today with mediocre teams will become irrelevant faster than ever before in human history.

***4th blunder: delusional expectations***

Joe was born into an extremely deluded world. Truths about how the world works have become lies as the world changed.

Joe grows up believing there is a middle class waiting for him when he gets older.

Once Joe understands that a middle class doesn't exist as he wished, he will believe that he will gain access to some sort of universal basic income / welfare that will satisfy his basic needs.

Once Joe realizes that his wants in life will never be fulfilled by any universal basic income or welfare, he will believe that the only solution is to reverse this rapid rise in asymmetry. 

Joe won't realize that this is not possible without reversing the fundamental nature of all of our minds: we want things, and we crave to get them as quickly as possible - which underpins the incentives that govern our world.

Joe will not realize that any efforts to overthrow this system will only reinforce it, and therefore will spend precious time on efforts that go against the incentives of our world. Joe will be extremely unhappy as he will likely not succeed in the revolution he craves (unless he somehow manages to destroy all of humanity and everything we've created). He will also not have the skill to create value in the world, and will not be satisfied with the universal basic income offered to him. Joe will likely sadly turn towards addictions that he believes will help him cope.

Joe will be frustrated that he world has shifted from rewarding ambition to requiring ambition to get what you want. He will want to leave the rat race behind and leave the world to live peacefully in some remote area. Joe will then face a harsh reality that the ambition required to create value in the world will look far less than the ambition required to leave everything behind. He will realize just how addicted he is to all of the comforts of the modern world.

---

We must not become Joe.

There has never been a better time in human history to get what you want, including happiness. The world is increasingly become fair, and we each have more knowledge and power at our fingertips than those that came before us. Yet, the path to getting what we want has become more narrow, as narrow as a razor's edge.

Fear equality. Fight for fairness. Overcome jealousy. Build compassion. Uncover the hidden accelerating asymmetries of the world. When you decide on how to respond, respond harder and faster than you feel you should. Accept that you will be ridiculed, hated even, for acting optimally.

What does the optimal path look like? It's one that enables you to benefit from the growing asymmetry rather than suffer from it. It's one that gives you more time to explore life the way you want to, not how someone else wants you to. It's one that lets you build the life you want.

In my next essay I'm going to share what I think this optimal path looks like given today's leverage in the world, and how that optimal path will change as we gain more leverage. Everything is a function of leverage. I'm incredibly surprised every day by how suboptimal I'm acting for almost everything I do. I'm struggling to change my outdated habits that have been ingrained for years. I suspect you too will be surprised.

[I'd appreciate your feedback](/feedback) on this essay.

### Notes

<Footnotes>
<Footnote number={1}>
You may say that modeling our endeavors as games is reductive. I agree that it is, but I believe it's still directionally correct - that the lessons we extrapolate from smaller games apply to the more complex games each of us plays to get what we want.
</Footnote>

<Footnote number={2}>
There are many ways to measure game complexity, and it's an active space of research. I've tried to provide a simpler definition to work with for now which I believe to be accurate enough for the sake of our discussion, and that any better measure of complexity shouldn't change the conclusions we derive from this.
</Footnote>

<Footnote number={3}>
I believe the difference in representational complexity of feeling and language will determine how long it takes to get to artificial general intelligence that surpasses human capabilities. I also believe that we're quite far away from that. Still, the advancements in the short-term will be rapid.
</Footnote>

<Footnote number={4}>
To be clear, when I say "outcomes" I only mean external outcomes: wealth, status, etc. It could be the case that the person who makes baskets is much happier.
</Footnote>

<Footnote number={5}>
I suspect the only role that most colleges play today is to put a bunch of sharp, ambitious people together. If those individuals were similarly grouped together outside of a college environment, I'm confident we'd still see incredible results, and possibly even much greater results because they'll have more time to work on what they want, not what they're told to. Also, as asymmetry rises, the value of a certificate disconnected from competence in the real world will fall sharply.
