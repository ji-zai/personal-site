A small percentage of books capture most of sales.
A small percentage of individuals hold most of the wealth.
A small percentage of employees in a company are responsible for the majority of output.
A small percentage of companies capture most of the market.
A small percentage of individuals contribute the majority of progress in any domain.

Asymmetry exists everywhere in our modern world and is rapidly accelerating. Yet, we deeply crave equality, symmetry. Our craving for equality blinds us to reality.

The more blind we are to reality, the more we suffer because as the world becomes more asymmetric, the right strategy to get what we want increasingly looks very different than what we do. As the world becomes more asymmetric we will find it more difficult than ever to get the things we want unless we adapt ourselves to be more aligned with reality.

Optimally organized companies, nations, teams, schools, governments, etc. all look quite different than how they are today. The optimal strategy is not only different, it's repulsive because it goes against our deeply held beliefs about how the world works. Our beliefs and habits are outdated.

We cannot stop the rise in asymmetry because it is intrinsically tied to human progress. Every single thing that we do: stories, technology, government policies, humanitarian efforts make our world more asymmetric.

To see why, we need to first understand what asymmetry even is, what causes it, see how it's changing, and understand how exactly that impacts our world. Then we can see where we're going wrong and try to make sense of it.

---

We can model the process we follow to get what we want (whatever that may be) as a game. The "winning" criteria is feeling the satiation from getting what we want and our process resembles a tree. Each decision we make leads to more decisions that have to be made.

Whether you want to build a great company, make an emotionally moving work of art, or even improve your relationships, the process you follow to get what you want resembles a decision tree. When you learn that something doesn't work you backtrack and go down a different branch. When something works you continue going down that branch.

The advantage of framing our endeavors as games is that we can study the nature of our endeavors by studying the nature of simpler, more well understood games, and extrapolating those learnings to the games that we play. [^1]

Games have a notion of "complexity" [^2]. While there are many ways to calculate complexity of a game it boils down to how many possibilities exist in the game. In a simple game there are only so many different moves a player can make, and only so many states that a player can end up in. More complex games have more moves (choices), more states, and therefore more possibilities.

Complexity is important for us to understand because asymmetry is a function of complexity. *The greater the complexity of the game, the greater the asymmetry that exists in the game.*

Let's look at three simple (relative to most of the games we play) games: Tic Tac Toe (simple game), Chess (medium complexity), and Go (high complexity), to get a sense for how asymmetry is related to the complexity of the game.

There are two ways we can observe asymmetry in these games:
1. Asymmetry in the moves (inputs).
2. Asymmetry in the outcomes (output).

For any given state of a game, each move you can take at from that state has a notion of "value". The higher the value of the move, the better it is.

By greater asymmetry in the moves, I mean that the range of values of the moves from any given state is greater, and also the difference between the best move and the next best move is greater.

For example, in Tic Tac Toe, between two trained players, there is only one possible value for each move: 0 - since two trained players in Tic Tac Toe will always draw.

Chess has a greater range of values than Tic Tac Toe, and Go has an even greater range due to its higher complexity.

The greater asymmetry in outcomes is a consequence of the greater asymmetry of moves. The difference between the best player and the second best player grows as the complexity of the game increases.

We can study this by analyzing the ELO ratings of professional players. ELO is a way to calculate relative skills of players:

> The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%
> 
> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)

It's important to note that the difference in rating doesn't translate linearly to the difference in wins. Someone who is a few hundred ELO rating higher than another will almost certainly win.

In Go, the difference in ELO rating of the top two players is 183 (https://www.goratings.org/en/), whereas in Chess, the difference in ELO rating of the top two Chess players is only 25 (https://www.chess.com/players).

The gap between the best and the next best is far greater in Go than in Chess. Meanwhile there's no need for ELO rating for Tic Tac Toe because every "professional" would draw, meaning everyone's ELO would be zero.

Asymmetry is not linear. The gap between the best player and the 2nd best player is larger than the gap between the 2nd best player and the 3rd best, and so on. The greater the complexity of the game, the greater the gap between the best and the rest, and the more skewed the curve looks.

And we can observe this fact in the ELO ratings of the games above. The difference between the 2nd and 3rd best players is lesser than the difference between the best and the 2nd best, and so on.

Lastly, we should notice that the more complex the game becomes, outcomes (i.e. ELO ratings) only become more equal the further you go towards worse players. *In other words, when two players are equally good it means that they're not close to the best player.*

Therefore, as the complexity of the game increases so does the asymmetry of the values of moves, as well as the asymmetry in outcomes. And lastly, asymmetry is not linear (i.e. the gap between 1 & 2 is greater than gap between 2 & 3, and so on).

The games we play today to get the things we want are much, much higher in complexity than the games we discussed above, leading to far greater asymmetry. 

Yet, complexity alone doesn't help us understand why asymmetry is growing. If the games we play have always been more complex than the board games we discussed, then why haven't we always seen a great deal of asymmetry in the world, and importantly, why is it increasing?

The complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. By leverage I mean: the time it takes to turn an idea into reality. The greater the leverage available to you, the less time it takes you to turn your ideas into reality.

Any human progress increases leverage, and spreads it to more people. For example, when a dictatorship is replaced by a democracy, the citizens gain leverage because they are more free and therefore can manifest their ideas that they previously couldn't. When a new technology is created, it reduces the time and effort to turn your idea into reality. 

Computers, internet, artificial intelligence, government policies, greater individual freedom, etc. all work to increase leverage in the world.

Greater leverage increases the complexity of the games we play in three ways:
1. By reducing the time per move.
2. By eliminating the need to play simpler games (because technology does it for us).
3. By increasing the possibilities within any game, thereby making the game more complex.

When it takes a long time to make a move, the underlying asymmetry doesn't manifest quickly. Imagine a game of chess where each move took 5 years to make. By the time the players die, their differences wouldn't be that apparent. It's not that the asymmetry wasn't there, but that it didn't have enough time to present itself.  Over the past decade technology has drastically reduced the time it takes to turn an idea into reality - i.e. the time it takes to make a move.

As leverage increases, we stop playing simpler games. Before we had computers, a large amount of time and effort was involved in keep track of numbers and basic numerical calculations. As we had better technology, we were able to shift more of our time to playing more complex games: figuring out what to create and how to create it.

And lastly, games that were always complex become even more complex due to leverage. Our ideas are subconsciously limited by the leverage we have available to us because our minds don't like to dream about things that it believes are impossible. Most filmmakers a century ago likely wouldn't have dreamt of making a film about intergalactic politics, and constrained their ideas to films that could take place in the normal world. As leverage increased, filmmakers were able to dream bigger and wider. Their minds opened up to more possibilities within the same game, making the game more complex.

I made a claim earlier that the games we play are far more complex than Chess and Go. A good reader would have been annoyed that I offered no explanation. Even though my intuition led me to write that claim quickly (and I suspect many readers would have a similar intuition), the explanation wasn't as straightforward as I initially felt it would be.

There is a hierarchy of complexity for human endeavors. The most complex human activities are the ones in which success is measured by how good we make people feel.

And the representational complexity of feeling is far greater than that of Chess or Go. By representational complexity I mean how easy it is to describe the state of the game at any moment in time. A game that has a much more complicated state, likely has many more possibilities for what moves you can take, and is therefore more complex in general.

To see why, recall when you had to communicate how you felt. You'll remember how difficult it is to do so, and importantly that no matter how many words you use, you weren't able to fully, completely, represent your feeling in words. This is because a feeling has a much higher representational complexity than words. Trying to represent a feeling in words is difficult because we are trying to represent something of a higher complexity into a medium that has less complexity. Information is bound to be lost in that translation.

It's precisely this lost information that allows for the various interpretations of words. Every single person reading this essay will have different feelings as they read this. Even though my intention is to make you feel what I feel about this topic, there is absolutely no way for me to do so without any loss of information, no matter what medium I use: words, images, videos, symbols, anything - even if I spend my entire life trying. I believe this gap between feeling and being able to express it is quite large.

The representational complexity of Chess and Go can easily be represented by symbols, and therefore I believe that any game in which success is measured by how good you make someone feel will be orders of magnitude more complex than Chess and Go (proportional to the difference in complexity between feeling and a sequence of symbols). Therefore, the underlying asymmetry that we are moving towards is quite extreme.

As leverage increases, we move up the complexity hierarchy to play games measured by how good you make people feel. A couple of centuries ago, most workers spent their time playing games that had nothing to do with how to make someone feel. They'd often assemble physical things in a factory. As that region progressed, they built better technology to require less workers to manufacture the same thing, and also offshored simpler work to other places, leaving workers to move up complexity towards services such as marketing, support, design, etc, which are closer to solving for how to make people feel good.

We notice this trend today as well. Programmers are being asked to become better at thinking about what to build and understanding users, without just thinking about how to build something (https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1637087219591659520). Animators are being asked to contribute something meaningful to the story instead of only translating a rough sketch into a completed animation. Pizza cooks, and ice cream store employees, are being asked to tell engaging stories on social media to attract more customers. Everyone is moving towards figuring out how to make people feel.

Artists for thousands of years have been solving for how to make people feel. Which is why it's no surprise that the arts have always had extreme asymmetry. Human progress is pushing us all towards the games that artists have been playing for a long time, and also the extreme asymmetry that artists have felt for a long time.

We can't be satisfied with any conclusions about asymmetry without also considering the role of fairness. The real world is not like a board game. Life's not fair.

Let's imagine a fairy tale world in which every child has loving, caring, supportive parents, the best teachers, the freedom to explore what they want. No one is concerned about how to make a living. Everyone has access to great healthcare, a fast fair legal system, etc.

In this imaginary world, we all have incredibly high leverage: anything we imagine can be manifested into reality quickly. Have an idea for an app? It will be built in a day according to your instructions and you can share it with the entire world. The same for a video, song, etc. Whatever you can imagine and express well enough through some mediums (language, drawing, etc.) someone or something will turn it into reality for you. In this world all you will care about is to create things that you and others want - whether that's art, better medical instruments, physical things, whatever you want.

What do you think the outcomes of this imaginary world would look like?

I believe it would be incredibly asymmetric. The richest person in this imaginary world will be so stupidly rich that it's unfathomable to us right now. And that there would be great variance in outcomes across the board.

I believe this to be true because in a highly leveraged world, we have more possibilities and we make moves much quicker. Therefore, slight differences in choices at the start of the game would lead to drastic differences by the time we die due to the complexity of the game.

And not all explorations are equally worthwhile. Someone who spends their entire life learning how to craft the best baskets to sell to their village will not have the same outcomes as someone who developed an interest for building, say, software. [^3]

Being influenced slightly differently early on, which leads to a slightly different choice will have incredibly large difference in where you end up. The greater the leverage, the greater the difference because the deeper in the game decision tree you can get to before you die as you can make many more moves.

Two twins that open up a social app and see two different videos are in influenced in subtly different ways. Each slightly different choice compounds greatly and they will end up in very different places in their exploration of life. The greater the leverage in the world, the more pronounced this difference. Twins born a century ago, on average, would have ended life with a less different exploration of life than twins today.

And this isn't even taking into account the difference in our abilities at birth! If we include that, then asymmetry will be even greater. I think it's silly to think that we're not born with different capabilities, different strengths and weaknesses, different emotional reactions to the same stimuli. Nature is an incredibly complex system - possibly more complex than our feelings. Expecting it to produce two equal things of anything is a delusion.

Therefore, in a fair, leveraged world in which our activities are complex, we would see extreme asymmetry.

---

Unfairness can also cause inequality. But the shape of the inequality caused by unfairness is fundamentally different than the shape of the inequality caused by fairness + leverage. Being able to differentiate between them is an important skill that as we'll see later, will help us navigate an asymmetric world.

Equality that stems from unfairness is different in that there are more rigid boundaries between classes, and it's more difficult to move from one class to another. Hierarchical caste systems that tell you what you can and cannot do with your life, and that you have different rights and potentials than other casts are incredibly unfair. Even in the industrial revolution, there was a large, rigid divide between workers and those that were able to afford to build factories - quite unfair, but less unfair than the caste systems that gave you absolutely no way to rise. There were at least a dozen factory workers across the entire industrial revolution that were able to start their own factories at some point. The same can't be said about someone born as an "untouchable" who wanted to, say, learn how to read and write.

The graph of outcomes in an unfair world looks like a step function. You will find different classes, and you'll see that there aren't any individuals with outcomes in between the outcomes of the two classes. In other words, all factory workers would make roughly equal outcomes, whereas all factory owners would make roughly equal outcomes, but you'd find very few in between the workers and the owners. This is a symptom of unfairness.

Inequality that stems from a complex world with fairness and leverage is a smoother curve: you will find individuals at all sorts of different outcomes. We can see this in the outcomes for our board game examples: though the difference between the best and the rest is large, if you plotted everyone on a graph, it would be much smoother than if you plotted all outcomes in the industrial revolution, and cultures with rigid caste systems.

When you look at those curves closely, you'll notice something interesting: the more unfair curves are also more "equal" because they have more people that are making roughly the same, but just divided by classes. Whereas the inequality from fairness and leverage is far less equal because it's tougher to find even two individuals with the same outcome.

*Therefore, counterintuitively, the way to sniff out unfairness is to see how much equality exists in the graph of outcomes*. The more equality that exists (i.e. the more it looks like a step function), the more cautious we ought to be. And complete equality (like the outcomes of Tic Tac Toe) is fair, but terrible, because it means our activities are not complex enough. It would be fair in that we'd all be equally terrible at life. But what you'll see in any unfair system is that there will always be someone who sits a step above a group of others who make equal outcomes.

The idea that a fair world would be equal is delusional. A more fair, more leveraged world will be more unequal in outcomes, because the underlying exploration of life will be more varied. And the inequality that stems from unfairness is actually more equal than the inequality that stems from fairness & leverage.

Human progress makes the world more fair by increasing leverage and spreading it wider.

Today, even in many of the poorest communities around the world, many kids have the ability to create, to speak their minds in ways their grandparents couldn't dream of, and have access to information and knowledge through the internet that is barely less than the richest kid living in a high rise building in Manhattan.

Yet, it's undeniable that the child that has access to higher quality feedback, more competent, ambitious peers, a stronger safety net, and more supportive loving parents, has an unfair advantage. We have a lot of work to do to make the world fair, but the world is more fair than it has ever been in modern history.

---

Asymmetry is a function of complexity. The greater the complexity of a game, the greater the asymmetry within the game and for the outcomes of the game.

The complexity of the games we play is a function of leverage. As leverage increases our activities become more complex.

Leverage is a function of human progress. Every advancement: technology, human rights, medicine, policy, etc. pushes us towards a more fair and leveraged world.

Therefore, asymmetry is rising due to progress.

---

But, asymmetry isn't rising linearly. Leverage is accelerating exponentially, and therefore so does the complexity of our activities, and therefore so does asymmetry.

Global GDP is a rough, but directionally correct, approximation of the leverage in the world. The more leverage that exists in the world means that we are able to turn more ideas into reality, creating and selling more things of higher value.

It's only a rough approximation because it only represents the transactions between us that involve a monetary exchange. There are many transactions that increase due to leverage that aren't directly captured by an exchange of money, such as liking posts on social media.

GDP is also a lagging indicator of leverage because it takes time to turn leverage into transactions because even though the time it takes to turn an idea to reality decreases, it's still not instantaneous. And often only implemented ideas have an opportunity to impact GDP.

We can see how leverage is accelerating exponentially by observing how our global GDP is accelerating exponentially: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run.

Therefore asymmetry is not just increasing, but increasing exponentially fast.

Intellectual understanding of asymmetry is not enough to act optimally in an asymmetric world that is rapidly accelerating in its asymmetry. 

We have two fundamental problems holding us back which stem from the limitations of our minds.

Our first problem is that we do not have an intuitive grasp of exponential change. Even if you intellectually see the current asymmetry of the world and how it's increasing rapidly, you will certainly be surprised and caught off guard. We don't have to look far back to see why. Before the COVID-19 pandemic took off, many nations and institutions had the math right: they could all see the rapid spread of the virus. Heck, even I read an essay in February that predicted that we'd have a pandemic. Yet, few, if any, of us had the appropriate emotional response. We lacked the appropriate fear and caution that would have enabled us to take the optimal path to preventing a pandemic.

Similarly, even if you believe everything you've read in this essay so far, I assure you that we'll all be very surprised as we see this asymmetry skyrocket on an exponential curve. And if you want to act optimally today, you're going to look stupid and be laughed at by the world in the same way that anyone who wore a mask in January 2020 would have been. 

And interestingly during COVID if you were acting optimally, you would have also been ridiculed later in the pandemic because you would have stopped masking before most others did, and would have been hated.

Since we all suck at responding optimally to exponential change, you will always look weird and stupid for acting optimally.

Also, any change you make in your life that is directionally correct will almost certainly not be a strong enough change. In the COVID analogy, if you believed the math that predicted it, even though the optimal strategy in Jan 2020 was to mask up, you would have just washed you hands an extra time thinking it's enough. This is because though we understand it intellectually, we don't have the appropriate fear (caution) towards it.

Our second problem is that we don't have the right emotional response to equality (symmetry). Instead of fearing equality as we should, we crave it. [^1] This makes shifting our behaviors to act optimally even more difficult than it would have been to act optimally towards a viral pandemic because we don't crave a pandemic (except maybe psychos) as we crave equality. Undoing craving and cultivating fear is more difficult than just cultivating fear. And it's not twice as difficult, it's orders of magnitude more difficult because overcoming craving is far more difficult than cultivating fear.

Our craving for equality blinds us to reality. The more disconnected our beliefs are from reality, the more we suffer. And reality is slipping away from us quickly. Through the following examples I hope to show how our intuitions are outdated

---

When a team leader sees that a group of teammates are performing equally well, they celebrate it, whereas they should be fear it. In a world with extreme asymmetry, equally performing teammates implies the following:
1. *The team is not well leveraged*. They are using outdated technology that is slower to turn their ideas into reality, or they don't know how to apply leverage effectively.
2. *The team consists of average players*. As we saw in our board games, the greater the asymmetry, the greater the difference between the top player and the next best. The difference between players only goes down the more you move towards the worst players. A team of terrible players would all be equally bad. A team of great players would have great differences in ability between them.
3. *The team's activities are not complex as they could be*. This is likely due to them not adapting themselves to an increase in leverage by moving up the complexity hierarchy to doing more complex work. For example: someone continuing to manually summarizing and transcribing notes, or coding simple functions when present technology can do it way more efficiently.
4. *The team leader is terrible at assessing productivity*. As leverage increases, productivity becomes more difficult to measure because the activities become more complex, but also because our craving for equality blinds us to just how differently able individuals are.
5. *The team is not moving fast enough*. Asymmetry manifests more slowly the slower a team executes (i.e. the slower they make their moves).

And the root cause of this is that the team does not consist of great players. If they were good, they'd be obsessed about increasing their leverage as much as possible, moving optimally fast, assessing productivity more accurately, and would be paranoid about not letting in average players who would pollute culture. As asymmetry rises, great teams will be far more asymmetric: the best will contribute significantly more than the rest.

You might say for the sake of the employees and society, teams shouldn't be obsessed about improving themselves by identifying their internal asymmetries (implying they shouldn't fire low performers). But the fact is that teams that don't organize themselves around asymmetry will find it incredibly difficult to survive. There is no stagnation in a rapidly changing world, there is only accelerated growth, and accelerated death. Companies will have no choice but to adapt or perish.

You may also believe that it's probably good to slow down this rate of change to make it easier on employees. Whether you realize it or not, by saying this you're also advocating for slower human progress meaning a slower rate of increase in fairness in the world. 

Everything is connected in ways that we may not like, but cannot deny.

Since asymmetry is indirectly a function of leverage, every time we see a bump in leverage (e.g. a more powerful AI model is released), we will notice massive layoffs, as well as a sharp rise in compensation and demand for top talent. Many are already feeling this "paradox": the job market seems terrible, yet companies are desperate for great talent and are willing to pay more than ever. Reality is giving us a wake up call.

---

A young person who wants to join a great company should fear companies in which there is great equality between employees. I often hear people coming back from interviews claiming "wow, everyone there seems great at what they do!", and end up joining the company. This was a great heuristic when we had less leverage (meaning the world was less asymmetric and there wasn't as great of a difference between great players), but is incredibly dangerous today.

A prospective employee with the right intuition would be paranoid about understanding whether the company is truly equal internally, or they're just saying they are. Of course, all companies (even the great ones) will claim they are equal internally because it's not culturally acceptable yet to claim that they aren't, but not uncovering the true inequality internally will lead a prospective employee to make incredibly suboptimal decisions. Choosing where you work is one of the most important decisions you'll make in your life. A miscalculation here leads to greatly suboptimal outcomes.

To be clear, there are many highly valued companies on the market that are incredibly equal internally, and therefore are rotting. A company's value is a lagging indicator of their health. Today's rot will manifest in earnings down the line. And so any job hunter that has the right intuition for asymmetry and how the world works should fear being lured in by a company's present market value if they're not set up for success in the future.

A great team is asymmetric, but not all asymmetric teams are great. If you notice asymmetry in a team and the best player doesn't seem unfathomably great, they're not a great team. And the degree of "unfathomable" increases as leverage increases in the world.

---

A prospective student that wants to join the best learning program, with the right intuition, would be fearful of any program that claims that a high percentage of its graduates are equally competent or have found jobs that pay similarly well. That's a sign that the graduates are average, and / or that they are joining companies that are average. Since there is no stagnation, only accelerated growth or death, those companies will become irrelevant more quickly than ever before, and these students will be left wondering what went wrong.

Selectivity is not what matters, it's the outcomes. A highly selective organization that still has equal outcomes is almost certainly a terrible one. A useless organization can still have asymmetric outcomes that make it seem that it's a great institution. They do this by simply bringing together a bunch of ambitious talent together and letting them do their thing. It's important to understand how much the institution is actually impacting the asymmetric outcomes. [^4] 

And lastly it's important to also be cautious of asymmetry when the best player is average. That means that not only is the institution not teaching the skills at the level of complexity required to be relevant in a highly leveraged world, it means they suck at teaching even simpler skills.

We need entirely new playbooks to optimally build companies, educate ourselves, and even build society [^5] that are aligned with sharply rising asymmetry. Some of these optimal paths will feel quite counterintuitive.

The need for compassion, towards others and ourselves, is greater than ever before.

Our minds have been programmed by evolution to respect those that achieve greater results, and respect less those who achieve less. This was a useful conditioning for back when we were hunter gatherers because in that context when an individual achieved less it meant less food for the tribe and everyone would suffer. Our craving for external validation, craving for status, and even our jealousy, helped us work hard to contribute equally well to the tribe, so that we weren't left behind.

Unfortunately in the modern world this evolutionary programming only leads to suffering. Our outdated emotional responses harm us instead of protecting us as they once did.

Asymmetry is inevitable, and it will always be the case that someone or the other achieves much, much more than you. Your neighbor, your childhood friends, a kid that wasn't even born when you started trying to be good at what you do will achieve more than you for reasons that won't be easy to decipher, and will increasingly be difficult to attribute to privilege.

This is why we see another "paradox": in the developed world we have more things, luxuries, and can manifest our ideas more quickly than ever before... yet, we seem less happy. Not retraining ourselves to be aligned with the growing asymmetry will also make us less happy. 

We will need to retrain ourselves to not put those who have more wealth or status on pedestals. And the only way to do that is to retrain ourselves to not think we are better than others who have less wealth or status than we do. The more asymmetric the world becomes, the more compassion we need to build in order to be happy - in ways that were not required in a more symmetric world. Unfortunately this is difficult to do. 

Just like how we see asymmetric outcomes in all external things, I predict we'll see a growing asymmetry in happiness as well. Those that can retrain their minds will find themselves incredibly happy. Those that cannot will be less happy than previous generations even though they have more than ever.

Acting optimally in an asymmetric world requires understanding ourselves, retraining our minds at the most fundamental level. In an extremely asymmetric world, to get what we want, we will need to work against the programming that evolution has given us.

---

Fear equality. Fight for fairness. Overcome jealousy. Build compassion. Uncover the underlying asymmetries of the world. When you decide on how to respond, respond harder and faster than you feel you should. Accept that you will be ridiculed, hated even, for acting optimally.

If you can manage to train yourself to be aligned with reality, there has never before been such an opportunity in human history to get what you want, whatever that may be.

I wish you the best.

Footnotes:

*When we don't have the right intuition for how to act optimally, heuristics are useful. Heuristics are like shortcuts or rules of thumb that help us shift our behaviors towards the optimal.*

*In subsequent essays I'll share the heuristics that I'm developing for myself to act optimally in an extremely asymmetric world. These heuristics have already impacted every aspect of my life (because asymmetry impacts every aspect of our lives): how I work, what ideas I think about, how I invest in my relationships, etc.*

*All I can say now is that I'm incredibly surprised every day by how suboptimal I'm acting for almost everything I do. I'm struggling to change my habits that have been ingrained for years, but are unfortunately outdated. I'm excited to share these heuristics with you in upcoming essays for your feedback. I suspect you too will be surprised.*

Annotations:

[^1] *Note: You may say that modeling our endeavors as games is reductive. I agree that it is, but I believe it's still directionally correct - that the lessons we extrapolate from smaller games apply to the more complex games each of us plays to get what we want. In future essays I plan to dive deeper into the nuances of the games we play, and specifically into the nature of our minds - which is what dictates why we want what we want and how we go about getting it.*

[^2] *note: there are many ways to measure game complexity, and it's an active space of research. I've tried to provide a simpler definition to work with for now which I believe to be accurate enough for the sake of our discussion, and that any better measure of complexity shouldn't change the conclusions we derive from this.*

[^3] *To be clear, when I say outcomes I don't mean anything about internal outcomes. It could be the case that the person who makes baskets is much happier. I mean only external outcomes: wealth, status, etc.*

[^4] *I suspect the only role that most colleges play today is to put a bunch of sharp, ambitious people together. If those individuals were similarly grouped together outside of a college environment, I'm confident we'd still see incredible results, and possibly even much greater results.*

[^5] *For example, we will need universal basic income*
