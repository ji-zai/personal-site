title: I'd appreciate your feedback

I'm deluded.

The more deluded I am, the more I suffer. Because the less my beliefs are aligned with reality, the more likely my actions will fail to give me the results that I want.

I write in order to identify and correct my own delusions, so that I can get what I want. I've noticed that no matter how deeply I think about something, feedback from others helps me identify my own delusions in ways that I can't do on my own. Your help is invaluable.

It's impossible for me to question every deeply held belief I have about how the world works. It could be the case that a subconscious delusion leads me down the wrong path. If my thinking is grounded in delusion, the conclusions I arrive at are bound to be deluded no matter how great my thinking is.<FootnoteReference number={1} />

You're incredibly deluded as well! But we're both certainly deluded in different ways. You'll be able to sniff out some of my delusions in ways that I can't because you might not share that exact delusion, or may not share it to the same degree. Our differences will help you push me to be less deluded.

This is why I'd greatly appreciate your feedback on my essays. I can't think well without your help.

For writing motivated in this way, I believe there is a great way to give feedback, and I ask that you try to give me great feedback. 

Negative feedback is far more valuable than positive feedback. Telling me something doesn't work or invalidating something I said is much more helpful than saying something is good. Avoid positive feedback. <FootnoteReference number={2} />

Attacking the foundation of the essay (the core point that everything is constructed upon) is more valuable than attacking a branch.

Providing evidence is more valuable than sharing a feeling. 

Evidence could be a reference, explanation, or even sharing an experience that is misaligned with what I claimed. All are valid. And I've often found that personal experiences & explanations are more valuable than referencing external sources because when we're thinking about something that is has only relatively recently entered our collective consciousness, there are fewer external references.

The problem with sharing a feeling on its own is that it's incredibly difficult to distinguish between a feeling that stems from your own delusion vs. a feeling that stems from an intuition that's aligned with reality. It's often the case that when you read something that is true but misaligned with your beliefs, you'll have a negative reaction to it: anger, fear, discomfort, something. <FootnoteReference number={3} />

Therefore when you tell me something feels off, I can't take it into account. Naturally if my writing is good, it make you feel that something is off because it challenges something you believe deeply. In fact, if you say nothing feels off that's a bigger red flag for me than if you say something feels off. I probably wouldn't publish an essay if multiple people say that it makes perfect sense.

That being said, I fully acknowledge that when something feels off to you, it could be because you're right and you've identified one of my delusions. I just ask that you try your best to express why something feels off. Try to translate your feeling into an explanation because that is something I can work with.

Tend towards attacking the foundation, providing evidence, translating feelings into explanations. The best feedback will force me to rewrite the essay.

At the very end of your feedback, I'd appreciate hearing from you the difference in how you felt before and after you read the essay, and what questions the essay has spawned in your mind. You will certainly have questions / ideas pop up in your mind that I haven't had because we are different. I want to steal the good ones.

As you can see, giving great feedback is a lot of effort. Reading an essay thoroughly, thinking deeply and writing feedback could take an hour or many. Why should you go through this effort to help me?

I think there are many benefits, but one outshines them all. By giving me great feedback I will hold you in high regard. I will want to collaborate with you. I will want to invite you to everything I do. I will want to share with you ideas much sooner.  I believe there's a dearth of quality thinking in our world, and by demonstrating your ability to think well, I will have no choice but to try and collaborate with you.

I have ambitious ideas that I believe will meaningfully impact the world if executed well. Give me great feedback to increase the chances of us working on them together. And of course you too will shape and own those ideas because as I said: I'm deluded. You will find ample opportunity to make every idea I have better and own them.

I look forward to hearing from you.

### Notes

<Footnotes>

<Footnote number={1}>
Subconscious delusion manifests as confirmation bias: no matter how much research I do, I may not be able to sniff out my delusion without your help.
</Footnote>

<Footnote number={2}>
I also view writing as a form of finding and eliminating what doesn't work without worrying about what works, therefore by showing me what doesn't work, your feedback fits more neatly in my workflow.
</Footnote>

<Footnote number={3}>
I believe we have negative reactions towards when we come across truths that contradict our beliefs. This happens because we're addicted to our beliefs, and the degree of negative reaction is proportional to the degree of our addiction. This is why the world often reacts with great hate towards people that speak truths that go against their deeply held beliefs. It's the same reaction you'd see from an addict who's prevented from chasing after what they're addicted to. Withdrawal symptoms can be nasty.
