title: I'd appreciate your feedback
date: May 2024

No matter how deeply I think about something, feedback from others helps me identify my own delusions in ways that I can't do on my own. Your help is invaluable.

Bias towards:
1. Negative feedback.
2. Attacking the foundation.
3. Providing evidence.

Telling me where I'm wrong is more helpful than telling me what you liked.

Destroying my foundation is better than disproving something that doesn't change the results.

Explaining your feelings with words is better than just saying something felt off. If my writing is good, it will make you feel that something is off because it challenges deeply held beliefs. Something could also feel off because it's wrong. Thus, a feeling is difficult to work with on its own.
