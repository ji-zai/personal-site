you can no longer fake it. if you're actually not good at building products (or whatever your job is), there is no longer a way to hide it. historically, you'd be able to hide your incompetencies behind a college degree from a top school, or by having a reputed company on your resume. you'd get interviews, and as long as you could solve whatever stupid coding puzzle they threw at you, you'd land a job.

that doesn't work in the age of AI.

AI is aggressively reducing the time it takes to build and ship products which makes the market more competitive. a company that makes slightly better decisions than another will swiftly overtake them - because each decision is implemented much more quickly. better companies compound more aggressively. mediocre companies will fail much faster than ever before.

in such a world, companies strongly feel the fear of being mediocre. they feel the fear of the competition attacking them from all sides. a small room of cracked builders can outcompete well funded companies in months.

this is why we're in the midst of a paradox: it seems as if the job market is terrible, but for those who have proof of their ability, this is the best job market they've ever experienced. sky high compensation for folks who can get the job done, and disdain for those who can't. the job market will become as polarized as social media, and our world at large.

it's no longer enough to say you worked on a great team. what did YOU do in that team? did you contribute something meaningfully, or were you dead weight? the individual brand matters more than ever. proof is the only resume that works. you can't just write about your ability to ship a great product (or design, or whatever) - you have to show it. there's no excuse.

a one line description of you, what you built, and a link to your app >> a page long resume. the concept of a resume itself is outdated. individuals will need to pitch themselves how startup founders pitch their companies to investors / sell to customers.
