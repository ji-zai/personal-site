Programmers are being asked to become better at thinking about what to build and understanding users, [without just thinking about how to build something](https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1637087219591659520). Animators are being asked to contribute something meaningful to the story instead of only translating a rough sketch into a completed animation. Pizza cooks, and ice cream store employees, are all being asked to tell engaging stories on social media to attract more customers.

***Everyone is moving towards solving for people.***

Artists for thousands of years have been solving for how to make people feel. Which is why it's no surprise that the arts have always had extreme inequality in ability. Human progress is pushing us all towards the games that artists have been playing for a long time, and also towards the intense inequality in outcomes that artists have felt for a long time.

Financial questions “are easy,” as Buffett says. “It’s the human problems that are the tough ones.” (this is a good one)

Explanation: the complexity 

"AI is bad news for people for math skills and society is going to shift in favor of people with strong verbal skills." - Peter Thiel recently. I agree but disagree with the framing. It's not about math vs. verbal, but solving for not people vs. people. And I will need to define the people aspect correctly.
