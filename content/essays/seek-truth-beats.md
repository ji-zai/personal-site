I) What is seeking truth
- Define "truth", "system", and "seeking truth"
- Why we want to seek truth
	- Nature of the human mind: wants, and wants what it wants as quickly as possible.
	- Even curiosity is a want.
	- Often, purpose is to gain power over a system.
		- Show how understanding gravity gave us power by enabling us to fly (planes) and cut short our travel time significantly.
- Is seeking truth a skill?
	- What even is a "skill"?
	- Define "delusion" in order to better explain seeking truth.
	- Contrived example of a small system that shows two individuals seeking the truth about it.
	- The factor of luck, and how, given enough time, you can factor out luck.
- What are the challenges in seeking truth?
	- I.e. what are all of the delusions that we can have about a system?
	- Describe each category of delusion.
	- Truth seeking is a collective effort, we often build on the results of those that came before us.
	- Inaccuracies compound with more layers.
- What it means to have skill in seeking truth
	- (summarize someone who can tackle all of the challenges above incredibly well).
- There is an optimal truth seeking strategy, that is generalizable.
	- This is the best we can hope to do, there is literally nothing more we can do.
	- Building this skill means that you can be put in any system, and get what you want out of it, given enough time.
- Self-delusion is the greatest delusion that keeps us from seeking truth optimally.
	- Yet, there is one delusion that I haven't yet talked about, but I think is the greatest delusion that holds us back from seeking truth effectively. There are many people in the world with the right theoretical understanding of optimal truth seeking, who still fail to seek truth effectively.
		- And it's easy to blame this on the factor of luck, whereas in reality it's not. In fact, given enough of a similar starting point, I think we overestimate the impact of luck.
	- My hunch is that most inaccuracies in seeking truth aren't from the inaccuracies in tools, or anything of that sort, they mostly stem from our self-delusion. Our delusion about how our minds work, holds us back. We are our worst enemies.

II) Self-delusion is the greatest delusion
- To explain this, proposing a theory of mind.
- Defining "feeling" and showing examples
- **Feeling has higher resolution than thinking**.
	- Clarify that this does not mean that feeling is more important than thinking. In fact, the lower resolution of thinking, especially language, is why it's so powerful.
- **Thinking is grounded in feeling.**
	- It doesn't exist in a vacuum.
	- In the extreme case: every thought is accompanied by a feeling. At least a lot more than we think.
	- A cycle: one influences the other.
	- Describe an anxiety attack / anger attack / depressive episode and how the mind can spiral into a state of heightened feeling.
	- Feeling definitely impacts thinking. And it seems like thinking may impact feeling as well. It seems like it.
- **Sensitivity**
	- My hunch is that most feeling is subconscious. Most of us, most of the time, have no idea what we're actually feeling.
	- A simple example to illustrate this: tension building up over time without us realizing it. They say many illnesses are rooted in the build up of stress over long periods of time. We only take action when we perceive it strongly enough. But the truth is likely that it's been building up subconsciously for a long, long time.
	- And this is why it is our "self-delusion" because we don't even see what's going on.
	- Is the degree to which you understand what you're actually feeling in this given moment.
	- Sensitivity changes over time, and is probably influenced by many factors.
- **Self-delusion.**
	- What it is.
	- Feelings are where our biases are embedded.
	- How exactly it holds us back from effectively seeking truth.
	- Take the simplest example of sending someone you love a message that you will regret when your mind settles.
- **The system of feeling**
	- Reframe everything using the language of systems.
	- Adding "medium of observation" as a property of seeking truth.
		- I.e. observation is done through feeling, not thinking, which means you cannot intellectualize what's happening: i.e. reading a study on how you feel anger when something happens is not the same as actually being aware of that anger.
	- How can this be seeking truth if it's a subjective individual experience? That makes no sense.
	- Well, firstly, even if your mind is completely unique in its feelings, you'll still want to understand it because it has the potential to impair your thinking.
	- **But, we are more similar than we think**. Globalization has shown this.
	- Art, products, ideologies, culture transcend human made identity boundaries: language, religions, color, anything you can think of.
	- Seeking your truth about your mind in the medium of feeling, will show you the nature of your own mind, as well as most other peoples'.
- **Truth seeking ability is generalizable, but only to the observation medium**
	- Reference the generalizable above, but add to it the qualifier: "by medium".
	- This is why you'll notice biases even in those that have the thinking muscle to seek truth.
	- And this is why there's an identity, and ideological even, divide between those that prefer one medium to another.
	- The muscle for observation is different. (one is to observe sensation, the other is to observe world using thinking - both are entirely different muscles. Training one doesn't necessarily train the other).
	- But having that preference itself is silly. They are both different ways to observe that offer you different information. As a seeker of truth, wouldn't you want to understand both?
		- Give good examples here:
			- Sama raising 8T.
			- Fridman thoughts on publishing the Bell curve data and arming racists.
- **Seeking truth well requires seeking truth in both mediums: thinking and feeling**
	- The ability to seek truth across many systems, and both mediums of observation (thinking & feeling) is required to do any kind of great work.
	- **How sensitivity reduces bias**:
		- In any system, understanding it more doesn't give you any power unless you're able to act according to your understanding.
			- E.g. knowing gravity isn't enough, you need to be able to apply those rules to make the things you want to happen happen. The same applies to the system of your mind.
		- Sensitivity alone doesn't mean your mind will somehow be less clouded. You'll just be better at knowing when it's clouded and to what extent. Yet, this understanding is invaluable.
		- **It's not easy to feel the way you want to feel**. This is why the advice "you need to see the facts objectively before drawing conclusions" is right in theory, but incredibly in-actionable because "objectivity" isn't a switch that can be turned on instantaneously. If it were the case, no one would choose to feel any emotion that hurts them, or clouds their view.
		- Feeling when your mind is compromised -> you can choose not to engage with it until it settles (go back to the angry message example). The less self-delusion re. what you're feeling, the more you can learn to wield your mind in more productive ways to get what you want.
			- Another example would be the food craving one: greater sensitivity means you can snap out of it before you open the door of your fridge, knowing that once you open it, the craving will be too strong.
			- And as you continue to be aware of when the mind is compromised and not act with it in those situations, you gain greater control over the mind.
		- There's this picture of someone with full control over their mind, full strength, balance, etc. Maybe they exist, but for most people I know who I would consider that way also feel many a feelings that have the potential to hold them back. They're simply better at wielding their minds carefully, cautiously so that they don't slash themselves with it. And over time it becomes easier and easier.
	- If you can only seek truth in feeling, but don't have the necessary thinking muscle, you cannot execute on it. How do you communicate feeling to the world?
	- If you can only seek truth in thinking, but are oblivious to the biases that feelings impose on the mind, you'll fail to see the most profound, obvious truths sitting right in front of you.
	- It's easier to be objective about someone else's problems. It's only when we're in the midst of a feelings "storm" that it becomes difficult to see clearly.

III) Seeking truth is the only skill
- **How technology impacts seeking truth**
	- Seeking truth is iteration: seek truth by "exploring" / "acting" in a system.
	- All acts of creation fundamentally are a process of seeking truth.
	- Technology reduces the effort to act to 0. Leaving only seeking truth.
	- Your relevance in the world simply comes down to your ability to seek truth. Now more than ever, and especially so as the power of technology increases exponentially.
- **All valuable skills are downstream of seeking truth**
	- Resilience, perseverance, determination, patience.
	- Ability to have great ideas.
	- Ambition.
	- Communication.
	- Mental balance.
	- All you need to do is to seek truth.
 - **Identity**
	 - We're so tied to our identity re. what we do to create value in the world.
	 - Part of the reason there is so much fear around AI (outside of the fear of it destroying humanity as we know it) is that AI is poised to invalidate our identities about what we think we are.
	 - Use the animation industry as an example: many animators that are not capable of seeking truth, will most definitely lose their jobs soon enough.
	 - The most robust identity to change is the ability to seek truth. If you're going to call yourself something, you ought to use a label that inherently correlates to seeking truth (it doesn't matter what the label is, if it doesn't correlate with seeking truth, it'll be irrelevant soon enough).
 - **The role of AI in seeking truth**
	 - I believe AI will be an invaluable tool for seeking truth. (explain why at a high level - this is another essay).
 - **Collective self-delusion**
	 - Collective delusion is raised to order of magnitude number of people.
	- How can we **collectively** be better at seeking truth? The closer we get to the optimal truth seeking in all domains of human endeavor, the closer we get to doing the best we can possibly do.
	- We are incredibly far from this optimal truth seeking. I'd guess somewhere around 0.01% of the world is close to optimal truth seeking. Just imagine the impact moving that decimal one to the right would have on our ability to tackle the greatest challenges for humanity?
	- What more can we ask from ourselves?
