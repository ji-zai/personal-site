### Why seek truth?

A truth is a reality of a system. A system is anything that has some phenomena happening inside of it. Physics, biology, chemistry, are all systems with varying events, characteristics and rules that govern them.

Because a truth is aligned with reality, it exists whether someone observes it, understands it, or even agrees with it. Gravity exists regardless of what anyone thinks about it.

Therefore, seeking truth is the process of understanding the realities of the systems that govern what you want.

Seeking truth only matters in the context of wanting something. If you don't want anything, then what's the point of seeking truth about anything? There is no such thing as understanding something for the sake of it, because even that curiosity is just a want: a want to understand the nature of something.

Skill in seeking truth is the same thing as skill in getting what you want. Therefore, if you're a human being that wants, then you'd benefit from learning how to seek truth more effectively, to the extent that it's possible to do so.

Therefore, skill in seeking truth lies at the foundation of any skill that we value, because any skill exists only if it enables you fulfill a certain kind of want. Skill in seeking truth lies at the core of skill in building a great company (a want to make a product people want, skill making great art (a want to express yourself).

You might wonder that such a general definition makes it useless. Of course when defined this way seeking truth is the only skill. But the generality is precisely where the value of studying this lies. 

If seeking truth is the most fundamental skill, then studying it should tell us more about the nature of learning, how to improve our ability to learn, to understand. It will show us which aspects of this skill are generalizable to any skill, and which are specific to what you're doing.

Using "Seeking truth" to define such a fundamental skill is useful because it's opinionated in a way that sheds more light on the nature of the process. "Seeking" implies that it is a search problem. And "truth" implies that there is some objectivity to it - that there is in fact a notion of "better" for any skill, that it's not entirely subjective.

And therefore, using this phrase to describe the most fundamental skill is far more useful than using something like "learning", "growing", etc. which don't offer such a glimpse into what it means.

Why study seeking truth when there's already so much wisdom around it? After all, in today's mainstream culture, phrases like "learn by doing", "the more you do, the better you get", or "you need to be resilient to do great work" are commonly used to describe how to get better at skills.

While I believe these advices are directionally correct, they can be dangerous when followed blindly.

For example, someone blindly following "resilience is required" may not choose to quit a path even though that's objectively the right thing to do to enable them to succeed. Someone who blindly follows "learn by doing", may not carve out the optimal time to study how to do it from those that are great.

And when we follow "the more you put out, the better you get", we assume that rate of output is the most important way to measure learning all of the time. And yet 

Dogmatic understanding of what it means to seek truth will lead us astray, if not now, then eventually.

Then there's the catch all term "judgement": knowing when to do what. We're advised to have better judgement so that we don't fall into the traps of dogmatically following approaches. Of course, this would be incredibly useful to train, but what does this mean and how do you get better at it? Is the only way to train this to keep performing your skill? Or are there other techniques we can use to improve this?

And then there's the "you can only answer these questions by doing". Once again, I think this advice is correct directionally, but creates the dangerous impression that there is nothing else that can be done to improve your rate of learning.

Therefore, to understand how true these pieces of advice are, and to see if there are any ways to get better at getting better itself, we have no choice but to study seeking truth with enough nuance and detail to hopefully help us form some useful opinions about the nature of learning itself.

Where do we start?

The only place we can start is by understanding how the mind works.

Any wisdom about how to improve assumes a theory of mind, whether it's explicit or implicit. "Resilience" is only required if the mind struggles when learning. "Doing is the best way to learn" implies that when the mind intellectualizes a skill, it's not enough to be good at it. We need to try and understand what aspects of the mind causes these behaviors.

When we have a more nuanced, precise theory of how the mind operates, how it seeks truth, and what can be done to change how it operates to improve our truth seeking ability, we should be able to derive and define all of the commonly used terms related to seeking truth.

And if there isn't much else we can do than just learn by performing any skill over and over again, at least we'll know why.

### The mind has a representation of what it believes is true.

Let's call this representation a our "model" of what we believe are the truths about the world.

We act according to this model in order to get the things that we want.

We fail to get what we want when:
1. Our model doesn't yet have sufficient truth about the systems that governs our want
2. Or, if our model is sufficiently mis-aligned from reality.
3. Or, despite having a powerful enough model, we cannot act on it.

The first scenario is when you don't feel you know exactly what to do to get what you want. The second is when you believe you know what to do to get what you want, but when you try it, you fail to get what you want. The last is the unfortunate situation of knowing exactly what to do, being aligned with reality, and yet unable to act on it for whatever reason.

To make our model more concrete, let's think of it as a spreadsheet with many rows, each corresponding to a truth you believe in. Obviously this is not how the mind represents information, but it offers us a valuable starting point to understand how the mind works at a high level, before we explore how it's represented in the framework of the brain / body.

Each row would have the following columns:
1. Your truth (a statement describing what you believe).
2. Confidence (how much you believe that your truth is actually aligned with reality).
3. Value (how much the mind values this truth - depending on how much it thinks this truth will help you get what you want as fast as possible.).

The "value" field of each row depends on what you want in that moment. And of course, you only value a truth if it helps you fulfill what you want in that moment.

There are 2 ways in which your model can be mis-aligned with reality: the degree to which your truth is wrong, and the degree to which you've "mis-valued" a truth: the degree to which what you thought it was worth (to help you get what you want) is different than what it was actually worth.

This implies there is an objectively "correct" value for a truth.

### How does the mind value a truth?

From nature's perspective, things just exist, and value can only be assigned by something that wants since only a being that wants has a notion of one truth being better than the other to help them get what they want. If you have no wants, there's no sense to value one truth over another.

Therefore, how the mind values a truth depends on your want. The value represents the degree to which the mind believes that this truth will enable you to get what you want. The mind values one truth more than another if it gets you more of what you want, more quickly.

Predictive power and relevance determine a truth's value.

Predictive power is how much that truth tells about the systems that govern your want.

For someone building a bridge, the truth about the formula for gravity is far more valuable than the truth: "when you throw something up, it will fall back down".

From the perspective of this engineer, both are true, but the formula for gravity tells them a lot more about the system they're operating in. They're able to predict how the system will behave without having to see that behavior.

They can tell a lot more because they can derive a variety of behaviors from the formula for gravity. A truth is more fundamental the more things that can be derived from it.

They know what forces will act on the bridge and can therefore plan for it without having to go through the process of building something that doesn't work, having it break, and then learning from it. This is invaluable.

Yet, a powerful truth is useless to you if it doesn't help them you what you want, i.e. it's not relevant to you.

For a person in a village who desperately needs to build a boat to get across a large body of water, e = mc^2 isn't valuable at all, even though it is an incredibly powerful truth that tells a lot about the world we live in.

Therefore, relevancy is critical for a person to value a truth.

Another way to look at it is:
- Relevancy is how aligned it is with your want.
- Power is the magnitude of the truth.

It may seem that the way a person values a truth is purely subjective, and changes from person to person. But there is an objective quality to it.

Two people with the same exact want, with sufficient time to seek truth about the systems that govern their want, will eventually converge towards the same values for truths pertaining to those systems.

For example, world leaders who want to keep their countries safe would all value greatly the truths about how nuclear weapons operate.

Therefore, from here on out, I'll refer to the "true value" of a truth for a given want to be the value that someone who has the want, and a complete understanding of all the systems that govern that want, would assign to this truth.

The more different two individual's wants are, the less we can objectively compare how much better one is valuing a truth than the other.

Therefore, I believe subjectivity exists to the extent that we want different things. And looking at the world it definitely seems that there is rich variety of human wants, and therefore it's difficult to compare how one person values, objectively with another's.

But, this becomes much more productive when we use it to compare how we value truths to ourselves in the past, for the same want. Improving the way we value a truth such that we get closer to assigning it a value closer to the "true value" is a key component of becoming better at what we do.

Let's call how the mind values a truth the "value function": a function that, for a particular want, and truth combination, returns a value for it. For now, to help us visualize our model, let's treat this value as a positive integer.

It's easy to see how the "true value" from the value we associate with a truth.

For example (show an example of someone who discovers something for the first time thinks it's a game changing breakthrough, that is stupidly valuable, but it's only after you discover something more powerful that you learn to put the previously highly valued truth in its place. Or even better: what seems like an unnecessary truth today, may actually be an incredibly valuable once sufficient understanding ripens in adjacent systems).

### Seeking truth is to reduce delusion in our model

Delusion in our model is the degree to which our value function is incorrect. A perfect value function would value wrong statements with 0, and will work its way up from there with more, and more powerful truths that help us get what we want.

It's only when we fully understand exactly how to get what we want, and we know it's aligned with reality (i.e. acting on it always gets us what we want), that we can see the true values for all the truths we've uncovered along the way.

In other words, we only see our delusion looking backwards. If we could see exactly what we're deluded about right now then we wouldn't be deluded about it.

This makes sense from our experience as a beginners. We don't really know what we're not doing well, though we can often see that it's not "great" by comparing ourselves with those that we think are great at the skill. When we get better, we can look back and see our foolishness due to the delusion we had in the past.

### What happens when we want something?

Firstly, our model is updated to reflect the values for this want. It must do this since our value function depends on the current want.

You might ask what happens when we want multiple things at once, a great question. I think that the mind focuses on one want at a time, and the feeling that we can multi-task seems to exist because we're not aware of the subtle jumps between wants that the mind is always making - sometimes within a single second. (reference the consciousness seems to be a single thread research paper from HN).

But even if you disagree, and and believe that multiple wants can exist simultaneously, understanding the cycle for a single want should still be useful.

When our model has our values for this want, the mind picks the top valued truth from the model and judges whether it can fulfill the want or not. 

Not all wants can be immediately fulfilled by the top-valued truth in our model because if that were the case, all of our wants would be fulfilled. Our delusion means that there are many wants that our model doesn't enable us to fulfill right away (by acting on our model).

This means that a want comes with some notion of a "fulfillment value": the minimum value of the top valued truth in our model that, if were to act on, would fulfill this want.

When our best truth fulfills our want, and you know exactly how to act on it, there is no need for seeking truth in this scenario.

You feel hunger, you want to eat something, and your best truth is that your fridge contains sufficient leftovers from brunch, then you simply act on this truth and go eat it.

When your best truth does not fulfill our want, we seek truth in order to improve your model so that your best truth can get you what you want.

---
### The mind seeks truth by observing, understanding, valuing, and predicting.

To observe is to perceive something happening. You can perceive this through any of your senses: see, hear, taste, feel, smell, or thinking (i.e. observing a thought). 

Think of this as the trigger for adding a new row to the model.

As soon as the mind observes something, it tries to understand it. In the way we've designed our model, to understand is to write a statement that describes the observation.

When an understanding happens, the mind applies its value function to this new truth, for the current want.

To predict is to guess other truths based on the ones already in your model. The mind tries to predict the truths that will help you get what you currently want.

A prediction is nothing but another row in your model, often with less confidence than the truths that you've derived directly from an observation. This makes sense as a guess wouldn't be a guess if you already had high confidence in it.

When a prediction adds a truth to the model, the mind understands is (i.e. assigns it a value).

The mind may predict through a variety of methods. For example, it may try to connect your current understanding to a new truth by asking questions, or maybe by a feeling. But regardless of the underlying mechanism (which we'll get to later), the end result is a truth with some level of confidence (i.e. a hunch / guess).

Each step in this cycle is a reaction. An understanding is a reaction to an observation or prediction. A prediction is a reaction to an understanding.

But where does an observation come from? I don't believe it comes from a void and that it's a direct reaction to a want.

When you want something, the mind is primed to observe things that it believes will help fulfill your want. 

Through all the senses, we consume a great deal of information, yet only a small fraction of that information rises to our conscious mind in a way that we can observe. What we want influences what reaches our conscious mind. And how intensely we want influences what our mind observes: the more intense, the more observations will be ones that your mind believes are more directly related to fulfilling your want. (note: easy to show this with example: tiger chasing you).

A want gives energy to this cycle. When the want dies down (either when it's fulfilled, or when it gets weaker on its own) this cycle no longer has the energy to keep going. (probably want to keep this later).

Similar to how there is an objective quality to the mind's value function (a person with the same want will value truths equally given sufficient truth seeking), there is an objective quality to how well the mind predicts.

### The mind predicts based on its notion of similarity between two truths.

For a person who wants to get across a lake, the truths: "wood floats on water", and "a sail can propel with wind", are far more similar than the truth "gold sinks in water" is with either of them.

Why is that? Because a person who wants to get across a body of water is probably not going to predict something about the floating nature of gold in water, as it's so unrelated to what they want. Similarly, they wouldn't predict the kind of insects that live in the wood after they understand "wood floats on water".

In other words, the similarity between two truths is the likelihood of you predicting one as a reaction to the understanding of the other.

Similarity doesn't seem to fully depend on the value the truths. You won't always predict truths that are valuable, and more often than not you'll predict a bunch of truths that are useless before you start to predict more useful ones. 

So similarity(t1, t2) and value(t) seem to be independent functions.

Similarity also impacts what you observe, because an observation can be a reaction to a prediction, and so if the similarity function determines prediction, it will impact observation since you'll only create experiments for what you predict. (note: what about the observation that is a direction reaction to a want and not a prediction?)

This similarity function creates "clusters" of truths. Therefore, as you seek truth, you'll tend to understand it in clusters.

Over time, as you understand more of the systems that govern your want, you'll realize that some clusters are much closer than you initially thought they were. (todo: show a good example for this).

Similar to the value function, there is a sense of objectivity to the similarity function, or in other words there's a "true similarity" between two truths, for a given want.

Two individuals with the same want, given infinite time to seek truth, will eventually converge on the same similarity function.

They'd have no choice but to see the similarity between two truths that initially seemed far apart if those two truths work together to help them get what they want.

For example, most people thought that the truths about rubber and metal were two "far apart" clusters of truths until we invented tools and materials that utilized both (like car tires). 

Then, they became more similar truths. When someone thinks about how to use rubber to get what they want, they're now more likely to think about the truths about metals as a way to reinforce the rubber in more useful ways. (todo: there's definitely a better example, but this conveys the gist of what I'm trying to get at).

### Seeking truth is a recursive search problem.

Eventually by seeking truth (observing, understanding, valuing, predicting), the mind finds a truth with sufficient value that could fulfill your current want.

Earlier, we saw that when you have a truth that fulfills your want, and you know how to act on it, then you'll simply act on it and get what you want. But there's one more scenario that I left out: when you don't know how to act on a truth that will get you what you want.

In this situation (and it's the most common situation we find ourselves in), we need to seek truth about how to act on this truth, in order to get what we want.

For example, let's say you want to build a software product to solve a particular problem that your friends have. By seeking truth (observing, understanding, valuing, predicting), you eventually predict that a particular product will solve the problem, i.e. will satisfy your want. But, if you don't know how to build the product (e.g. write software), then despite having a truth with sufficient value, you cannot act on it.

When this happens, a new want is generated: the want to learn how to act on your best truth, so that you can get what you want.

this want is a sort of "child" want to the "parent" want of building a product to solve a problem. In order to fulfill the parent want, the child want must be fulfilled, and so another cycle of seeking truth starts.

The search resembles a tree: with your first want at the root, with children wants and their children wants.

(todo: show the image).
### When do we stop the search in the child want?

When does the mind stop the search in the child and come back to the parent want?
Either when:
1. The want is sufficiently fulfilled (i.e. it has been acted on fully and therefore satiated)
2. Or you run out of patience.

The want is fulfilled when your best truth satisfies it AND you know exactly how to act on it. There is no more room for a question on how to act on it, and therefore a new child want isn't generated.

This can take some time and going down many, many layers of the tree.

But more often than not, what happens is that we run out of patience exploring a branch of the tree, when we don't find a truth with sufficient value, and therefore we "come back up" to the parent want having concluded that the branch isn't going to be fruitful.

When this satiation or impatience causes us to climb back up to the parent want, our model is updated.
### When we're satiated or lose patience, the mind updates our model.s

### The mind also updates its value and similarity functions.

### Delusion compounds exponentially.

### Seeking truth follows the power law.

### How much of it is a skill?
