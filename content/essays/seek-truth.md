### There is only one skill

I believe there is only one skill that lies at the root of all skills: seeking truth.

Our ability to get what we want depends on how good we are this skill. Improving this skill positively impacts our ability to get what we want. And it doesn’t matter what it is that we want.

Unfortunately, we’re terrible at it.

Partly because of limitations of ourselves (the human condition) and inability of our minds to understand the incredibly complex world and universe that we operate in.

But, mostly because we haven’t sufficiently studied what this skill is and how to improve it. I believe we are very far from being as good as we can be individually, and by extension, as a species we are incredibly far from being as good as we can be to get what we collectively want: i.e. solving all of humanity’s problems.

I started writing this essay to understand how to become better at my craft: building products and companies. But the more I made sense of what held me back, the more I realized the same things held me back from every single thing that I aimed to be great at. Whether that was becoming a better friend, son, partner, or becoming better at having ideas, or becoming better at communicating, or understanding myself, or even becoming better at being at peace.

The underlying principles are the exact same, because fundamentally, they all require us to use a common set of tools: a mind and body. Our mind fundamentally doesn’t change how it approaches getting what it wants, no matter what that want is. Whether it is to build a great product, to create a meaningful song, to dance well, to connect with others, or anything. All visible differences are surface level.

I was selfishly excited by this realization because it meant that if I studied in depth the essence of what held me back in one domain, I could improve my ability to get anything I want.

After studying how the world is changing, I also believe that it’s more important now than ever before to become great at this skill because the penalty for being bad at it is rising. That sounds like a paradox: with greater technology shouldn’t it be easier for us to get what we want, and therefore shouldn’t the bar for this skill be lowered? That’s not what happens because our wants evolve in response to technology. When it gets easy to get what we want, we move the goalpost for what we want. Our expectations rise.

That’s both the blessing and the curse of the human condition. It means that we are always aiming higher, growing, and improving ourselves. There’s always room to want more.

And because our wants are more difficult to fulfill, it is incredibly important to improve our ability to seek truth, so that we improve our skill to match the higher difficulty of our wants.

But, even if you don’t buy that it will become more difficult to get what we want, if you want to improve your ability to get what you want today, it would still make sense to study how.

I’ve divided this essay into 3 sections. In the first I walk through what I mean when I say “seek truth”. I then explore what mastery looks through examples to help us see what makes someone great and how they are different from the rest of us. Lastly, I’ll discuss how I see the world changing and how the nature of this skill is changing in response to the changing world.

Understanding how the world is changing and how that impacts this skill is critical because it directly impacts the way we train ourselves. If we train a muscle that it turns out won't be required soon, then it's wasted effort. It could also be dangerous if we train ourselves in ways that will make us worse at seeking truth in the long-run. We will only know that if we understand how this skill itself will change over time.

### On seeking truth

In its essence, seeking truth is to understand how things work in order to get what we want.

That sounds incredibly obvious. Why can’t we just call it “understanding things” and just get on with it? Because while it’s true, it’s incredibly inaccurate. And an inaccurate understanding means it’s difficult to act on it. After all, all of us are trying to understand things to get what we want, and yet there’s a lot of room for improvement.

I like “seek truth” as the name for this skill because it hints at certain non-intuitive qualities about the process.

“Seek” means always striving, but never getting. For anyone that has tried to understand anything, it will be clear that we can only improve our understanding but never fully know. There is always greater understanding to be had.

“Seek” also implies that it is a search problem. And I believe that representing this process as a recursive search problem is the right way to think about it.

“Truth” implies that there is at least some sense of order to the world. For example, the equation that represents gravity is a truth that represents how two bodies of masses interact with each other. Similarly, there is a sense of order to every aspect of world: business, arts, policy etc.

Truth also implies that there is reality. And the fact that we are seeking truth means that we don’t fully understand reality.

Another important point is that seeking truth only matters if you want things. If you don’t want anything, there is no need to seek truth. Each want has its own truth seeking process, and of course it’s possible to be good at fulfilling one want but not another.

---

### Truth & delusion

We’ll need to define a few fundamental concepts in order for us to build up a model of what seeking truth means.

Let’s define “truth” as a statement (for now let’s consider this statement to be in English / mathematical notation).

(note: Of course a statement written in English that describes something can never fully represent it, but let’s ignore this for now since that leads to an unnecessarily philosophical tangent. By treating it as a statement, we can still build a reasonably accurate model of seeking truth.)

Each of us has a set of truths that we believe to be true. These truths that we live by impact the way we live our lives, what we do, and how we go about getting the things we want.

Naturally, the truths we believe in are not always aligned with reality to varying degrees.

Let’s define “delusion” as the degree to which a belief is mis-aligned with reality. We are deluded to the degree what we believe in is mis-aligned with reality.

When we seek truth and understand more about the world, we form beliefs about what is true. This may include clearing out beliefs we had that we realized weren’t actually true, and forming new beliefs that we didn’t have before about what is true.

The challenge with delusion is that we can only see it in hindsight. When we are deluded about something, we don’t know what we’re deluded about, because if we knew exactly what it was, it would no longer be a delusion.

We’re also deluded about the things we don’t know, not just our inaccurate beliefs. E.g. someone who wants to get something but has no idea how to is quite deluded, as is someone who has very strong beliefs about how to get what they want but all of their beliefs are glaringly incorrect. Are there situations in which one kind of delusion is better than the other? I think so, and we’ll explore this as we dive deeper.

---

### A truth has a notion of value

The value of a truth corresponds with how helpful it is in enabling you to get what you want. The notion of “value” only exists when coupled with a want. Nature has no notion of value, everything is just true. Only a being that wants, values.

For example, if you want to build a bridge understanding the truths about gravity, forces, materials, resistance, etc. are incredibly valuable, while truths about how to make music wouldn’t be.

Of course our wants can change. Value of a truth changes over time, depending on how wants change. Something you valued highly when you wanted something, you may not value at all once that want passes - until the want returns.

---

### Values of truths follow a power law

For a given want, some truths are orders of magnitude more valuable than others.

This is just an observation of nature. I don’t know why this is the case, but it seems to be true if we look back at how we've uncovered truths about the world.

For example, for someone that wants to build a bridge, the truth about the equation of gravity is orders of magnitude more valuable than the truth "when you throw a ball up it falls down".

Both are true, yet one is far more valuable because of its predictive power: it explains far more about the world, and therefore you can leverage that truth to get more of what you want, more quickly, for longer periods of time (i.e. robust to change).

At times you’ll need to uncover multiple truths in order to “unlock” a significantly higher valued truth. This feature of truths seeking is the hallmark of human progress. We collectively uncover a set of truths, and then someone connects the dots and finds a much more valuable underlying truth that explains them all, and also explains phenomena that we might not have even understood yet.

These are breakthroughs, and we find them in every field. Companies too are founded on a set of truths that the founders believe about the world. And if the truths they build the company on are incredibly valuable, they are far more likely to succeed and build a generational company.

Art is also grounded in some truths the artist feels about the human condition. Every now and then we find an artist that expresses these truths in such a profound way that we can't help but be moved by them. They create a new trend.

Seeking truth is all about uncovering such higher valued truths so that we can be much better at getting what we want.

---

### Wants have expectations

When you want something and you don't know how to fulfill it it means the highest value truth you believe in (for this want) isn't high enough value to enable you to fulfill it.

---

### Ability to act

If you can’t act on beliefs, you can’t get what you want.

Acting is doing things that aren't directly related to updating your beliefs. For example, if you want to eat food and you believe that there are leftovers in your refrigerator, acting would be you grabbing that food and eating it.

Similarly, if you want to edit a video, don't know how to (i.e. the highest value truth you believe in isn't sufficient to fulfill this want), and believe that searching online will lead you to learning how, then acting on that belief would be typing the search term in your phone and pressing submit.

By not being able to act, not only would you not get what you want, you won't be able to improve your beliefs. Acting is what shows you whether what you believed will fulfill your want actually does. And when it doesn't, you're forced to improve your understanding.

---

### A want leads to more wants

When you want something and you know how to get it, there's of course no need to seek truth, you'll simply act on your beliefs and get what you want.

Seeking truth only happens when you are unable to fulfill your want in this moment. This pushes you to uncover more valuable truths than the ones you already believe in, to fulfill your want.

In this process, you may uncover a truth that you believe is valuable enough to fulfill your want, but you still cannot act on that truth to get what you want. When this happens, your mind generates a new want: the want to be able to act on the truth. Let's call this new want a "child" of the initial "parent" want.

For example, let's say you have a want to solve a problem you have by building an app. By seeking truth you uncover the truth: "The solution can be coded using acme programming framework.". You believe this truth, but you don't know how to program in that way.

When this happens, a child want is formed: the want to learn how to code in the acme framework in order to build the app, in order to fulfill your want to solve your problem.

Similarly, the child want will generate more child wants.

---

### Seeking truth is a recursive search for higher value truths

Recursion is a method of solving a problem where a solution depends on the solution of smaller instances of the same problem. And therefore fulfilling a want is a recursive process.

To solve for one want, we often must solve for other wants, and therefore the process of getting what we want (seeking truth) is a recursive process.

This process looks like a tree.

(todo: a stellar animation to show how this works)

---

### Time is scarce

Most of our wants are difficult to fulfill. What this means is that there are many, many sub-trees. So many that it feels infinite (and maybe it is?).

Yet, we want to get what we want as quickly as possible.

This is what creates the necessary tension in our system to push us to be more effective at seeking truth. Otherwise we would have infinite patience.

If we didn't want to get what we wanted as quickly as possible, then we'd just keep going down a single branch of the tree without ever coming back up. With infinite patience there would be no need to stop exploring a path even when it doesn't enable us to get what we want.

Of course that doesn't happen becuase we become frustrated the longer we go without getting what we want. This is useful. Without this frustration (or discomfort / agitation - whatever you want to call it), time would not be scarce for us, and there would be no need to be effective at seeking truth.

Understanding time is scarce allows us to define how good someone is at seeking truth as how quickly they can get what they want.

---

### Satiation & the lack of it

Satiation occurs when we get what we want. It's a feeling that we all like and want more of. Our craving for satiation pushes us to seek truth to get what we want.

Lack of satiation is proportional to the time you've spent seeking truth without satiating your want. The longer you are seeking truth about a want and unable to uncover a truth you believe will fulfill your want (i.e. a truth with high enough value), the less patience you have left. With enough time passed, you will give up on that direction.

Interestingly, we're not just satiated when we act on our beliefs and get what we want, but also when we uncover a truth that we believe will help us get what we want. This means that every time we move deeper down the tree, we experience a sort of satiation.

This feature is why often find ourselves stuck in sub-trees completely forgeting how we got there in the first place, and why we become addicted to the act of seeking itself. Perhaps this is why we are always in pursuit of things. Uncovering new truths is growth, and we are addicted to growing.

If we didn't experience satiation every time we uncovered a valuable truth, and only when we acted on beliefs to get what we wanted, we would not be able to work on ambitious, long-term projects. Long-term projects require us to spend a lot of time seeking truth before we can execute and get what we want.

For example, an author that wants to write a well meaningful, well received book may spend months writing it before publishing it to the world. If they didn't feel some satiation every time they had a great idea they thought would work, or when they received valuable feedback from a friend that improves their beliefs about what will work, they wouldn't last the process. We can say the same about the scientific journey, building products, etc.

I like to think of this mechanism of satiation as a sort of "energy bar" that we find in video games. We have a patience bar for each want we have, and every moment we don't have a truth that we believe will fulfill our want, the energy bar is slightly depleted.

Every time we uncover a truth that we believe will fulfill our want, our patience bar is bumped up a bit (proportional to how valuable the truth is).

When the energy bar is completely depleted, that child want disappears, and we move back up to the parent want ready to explore another child, and so on until this want's energy bar is also depleted.

(todo: animation that represents satiation as a "health bar" like in video games, but every moment it depletes. When you uncover a truth, you get a slight bump up. The animation should show a person going a couple of levels deep and coming back up when the satiation runs out).

How quickly our patience bar runs out differs for each of us, and also depends on the want and how difficult it is to seek truth for it.

There's also a different degree of satiation from actually acting on the belief and getting what we want (destination) vs. uncovering truths and learning (journey). When satiation of the destination is greater than the satiation of the journey, you probably don't like what you're doing. And if you do like what you're doing, the satiation of the destination isn't that fulfilling.

Satiation from the journey is valuable, but over-satiation from the journey is a common factor for why we are ineffective at seeking truth.

An example from the world of startups that I see often: a founder that sets off to solve a problem that ends up falling in love with the satiation that comes from building the product. They overemphasize building over other critical functions of growing a company and therefore fail to create something people actually use. (and you can find such examples in any skill).

### Our model of seeking truth

- todo: do this at the end, after the entire draft is complete. This will predominantly be a visualization exercise.
- Solid animation. Use a real world example.
- Will need to speak to how priorities shift because how you value the truth change.

### There is an objectively accurate value for a truth.

Given a want, a truth has an objectively accurate value.

To see why we can look at when we've improved our ability to seek truth for a want. When we start learning how to get what we want, we often prioritize truths that aren't the best truths to prioritize. Only after improving can we look back and see how we've mis-prioritized.

This mis-prioritization implies that for that want, we were initially inaccurate in how we valued truths, and over time became more accurate (i.e. better), allowing us to prioritize paths of exploration that are more fruitful.

Another way to see it is to imagine someone who understands everything about the entire universe that has uncovered all the truths that can be uncovered (an all knowing being). Given this understanding they would be able to assign the perfect value for a truth - for a particular want. And they would also perfectly assign the value 0 to anything that doesn't correlate with fulfilling the want.

Every time we improve, we approach a bit closer to this perfectly accurate value for a truth, but of course achieving it is impractical as the only way you would know you are there is if you knew everything that impacts that want.

Objectivity is useful because it means we can become better: by being more accurate in how we value truths. And objectivity is useful to compare individuals in a group that all share the same / similar want, as we'll do later to study how the world is changing.

Subjectivity also exists to the degree that the wants are different. When two people value truths differently, it doesn’t mean one is better and the other is worse if they want different things. In the extreme case: two people with very different wants will value the same truth quite differently, while both could potentially be valuing it accurately.

---

### We blunder

Now that we have a model for what seeking truth is and have established a notion of objectivity, we can bring clarity to all the ways we blunder. Understanding how we blunder shows us where our potential for improvement is.

What is a blunder? We can only define blunder in terms of time because time is our only scarcity. Blunder is something we do that overly delays our ability to get what we want - i.e. to uncover higher valued truths. Some blunders are more costly than others. For example, someone who only always explores only the first prediction they have, will likely not only delay their ability to uncover high valued truths, but will never even uncover them before they die.

And naturally, more problematic than an individual blunder is consistently making blunders.

The first category of blunders stem from not knowing what we don't know. Given the information we've been exposed to, we are guaranteed to make mistakes that the all knowing being wouldn't make. And there is no way for us to not make such mistakes.

Of course a good truth seeker would work hard to minimize this gap. But even if you were to learn about all the truths that all humans have collectively uncovered for the history of humanity, there would still be a massive gap between us and the hypothetical all knowing being. And this gap naturally translates to massive blunders. Blunders we can do nothing about.

I suspect this gap is massive: that we have barely scratched the surface of all there is to know in the universe. Therefore, even the best human truth seeker will make many, many blunders that they will realize in hindsight as they learn more about the world.

If those great at what they do published all of their thinking and notes, it would be clear just how many misteps, backtracking, adjusting, etc. that takes place. It's not possible to be at the frontier of any skill without committing many blunders due to how little we know.

The corrollary is also important: if we are not blundering much in our exploration, it probably means that we're not pushing the boundaries of human understanding and capacity.

But, this is an incredibly dangerous belief because it leads to laziness. We'd develop a tendency to disown our blunders and pat ourselves on the back thinking we're pushing the boundaries whereas in reality we're just blundering due to stupidity that is entirely in our control to change.

But not acknowledging that masters will also blunder massively paints an unrealistic expectation of what mastery looks like, and so as someone seeking truth about seeking truth, I can't not acknowledge this fundamental truth about mastery.

**Therefore the goal is not to not blunder, but to not blunder in ways that we can avoid.**

Unlike most of us, the master is obsessed with discerning which blunders are the result of their lack in skill, and which blunders were inevitable. They know that this miscalculation is biggest blunder of them all.

### How do we blunder?

Accoridng to our model of seeking truth as a search problem represented by a tree of possibilities, our blunders look like the following:

1. We assign a value to a truth that is lower than it should be, leading us to ignore a valuable path.
2. We assign a value to a truth that is higher than it should be, leading us down a path that isn’t nearly as fruitful as another.
3. We quit a branch too soon.
4. We don’t quit a branch soon enough.
5. We act too soon, without giving ourselves time to predict, thereby seeing less possible paths and missing the best ones.
6. We take too long to act, and spend too much time thinking and predicting beyond a necessary point that won’t improve the paths available to us.
7. We don’t spend as much time as we could to seeking truth.

What’s clear is that there are tradeoffs for everything except for one thing: how much time we spend seeking truth to get what we want. That if you find a way to commit more time to seeking truth for a particular want, you will get better at fulfilling that want.

For the others, there is a tradeoff, and a tradeoff implies there’s an optimal point. And the answer to what that optimal point is, is of course “it depends”. But what does it depend on? And are the factors on which it depends on changing? If so, how does the change in factors impact how the optimal point shifts?

In order to be able to draw valuable conclusions and make predictions that actually help us become better at seeking truth and getting what we want, we need to dig much deeper to better understand why we commit these blunders.

Specifically, we need to understand how the mind goes from what it understands to predicting truths. This is how the search tree is formed. If you act only based on what you know and see without predicting, you won't get far in your ability to get what you want.

To explain what happens in this process, we need a theory of mind: how the mind observes, understands, values, and predicts truths.

## II: Four functions of mind

### Our senses capture more information than we notice

The mind is constantly perceiving information that comes through the senses. This is a subconscious process. We do not consciously take note of most of the information that is absorbed through the senses. We're talking about nonstop recording of audio, visual, sensations, smell, tastes that we experience every moment. What we can recall is only a tiny, tiny sliver of the information that passes through us.

This perception has nothing to do with seeking truth. It just happens to the degree that our sense organs are intact, functioning, and to the extent that the parts of our brain responsible for capturing the data our sense organs transmit are intact. I predict that most healthy people consume similar information when put in similar environments.

The differences between us start from the next function.

---

### 4 functions of the mind

1. Observe: to consciously notice of some phenomena.
2. Understand: to turn an observation into a truth.
3. Value: to assign a value to the truth.
4. Predict: to predict new truths based on what the mind believes to be true.

The way each function operates depends on what you want in that moment.

---

### 1. Observe

By observation I mean your attention falling on something. When you receive an email, before you even read and understand it, your attention goes to the first word of the email. That's what I mean by an observation. Or when you're walking and your attention goes to a falling tree - you've observed it.

We only consciously observe a small sliver of information that enter our minds from our environment in any given moment. It's quite easy to test this out: just try to remember everything happening around you a minute ago. You'll be able to remember it, but whatever you can recall, when compared to the information gathered by a host of computer sensors that capture audio, video, smell, the sensations that happen in your body (e.g. heart beating, the touch of the table on your hands, etc.), and all the tastes that occur in your mouth, what you remember is a tiny, tiny sliver of all the things that your senses actually felt in that moment.

Therefore, at any given moment in time, we only consciously observe a small sliver of the reality of the moment. And especially so if we're not present.

This means that technically it's possible for both of us to be in the same room, consume the same exact information (or quite similar), and yet have entirely different observations. And we see this happen often. A great painter will observe very different things than a novice when looking at the same paining. A great graphic designer will notice very different things than a novice when looking at the same piece of design.

And similarly for other things, we will observe similar things given the same information. For example, when two individuals go on a walk and hear a loud bang near them, they will both observe that bang. Therefore, our observations can be similar or quite different - even when we consume the same information through our senses.

---

### 2. Understand

After we observe something, the mind works to form a belief about what is true. By understanding, I mean his process of forming a belief based on an observation.

To be clear, this belief that is formed through understanding has nothing to do with a thought. For example, someone who observes a tree float down a river doesn't need to have the thought "tree floats on water" for them to understand it. Even before language was invented, in the days of cavepeople, they understood things such as sticking your hand in fire will burn you. Animals too understand various aspects of reality and nature without having to actively think about it (using language, imagination, or anything).

Therefore my earlier definition of belief as a statement is inaccurate. In reality, the statement only approximates what the underlying belief is. Of course, when discussing specific beliefs I'll continue to describe them in an English statement (or pictures, videos, etc.) simply because I have no better tools to describe them to you. But any such representation only approximates the underlying belief.

Similar to how we can consume the same information and observe two entirely different things, it's possible to observe the same thing, and yet form two entirely different beliefs about what is true, even when we want the same exact thing.

For example, two individuals are walking on a path in a forest and both observe the same thing in the distance. One jumps up in fear because they've understood it to be a snake, while the other doesn't react because they understood it to be a piece of rope someone left behind.

Or two students that both want the same thing, to get good grades, hear the same advice "work hard", who both agree with it wholeheartedly, yet form entirely different beliefs about what "work hard" means and therefore act quite differently.

You might say that ambiguity leads to different beliefs, and that if there was nothing ambiguous, they'd have the same exact understanding. You're right about ambiguity impacting understanding, which is why being as precise as possible in how we communicate is important. But it's not possible to have no ambiguity in communication. For example, I challenge you to teach someone a worthwhile skill (for example, how to write well) without any ambiguity. You simply can't. Even if you spent all your life writing the guide for how to write well, you cannot help but have ambiguity. And that is partly becuase ambiguity is necessary! Most great advice for any reasonably difficult skill often has an underlying tone of "you need to learn when to do what", and "you need to see for yourself how to do it, and find your own style", and even "you need to build your own intuition".

Ambiguity is inevitable, and therefore there will be room for us to form different beliefs about an observation. The more ambiguous, the more room.

---

### 3. Value

After the mind generates a belief through understanding an observation, it assigns it a value. This value enables us to prioritize this belief.

As with all of the functions, how you value a truth you believe in depends on what you want in that moment. If you want to eat food, the values of all the truths relevant fulfilling your hunger are higher than the truths not relevant to food.

And similar to observing and understanding, there can be a great difference in how two individuals value a belief, even if their belief is exactly the same, even if they want the same exact thing.

For example, two researchers at an institution that want the same thing: to publish groundbreaking research that fundamentally changes how we understand something, who are working on the same problem, may both observe and understand a paper published in a conference that talks about a novel way to do something that they both think is important to help them with their research. Yet, one of the researchers may value it incredibly highly, and therefore drops everything they're doing to focus on applying the novel technique to one of their problems, while the other researcher decides to focus on it after a few months - once they're done with their current experiment.

The same observation and same belief, for the same want, may still lead two minds to assign very different values.

---

### 4. Predict

The mind forms new beliefs based on the truths it already believes in, and how it values them.

Predicting truths often manifests as questions. For example, when you ask the question about whether A is better than B (for whatever that is), you have likely already predicted A is better than B, but with a low confidence (i.e. you don't know for sure), and therefore the question arises.

But, even in the scenario in which you truly don't know which is better there are underlying predictions that led to the question. You predicted both that A can be better than B, and that B can be better than A, or they can be similar, and therefore these predictions have led to a question.
More often than not, we don't predict anything, and therefore we don't even have the question arise.

Just like the above function, two individuals with the exact same want, same beliefs, same values for those beliefs, may still predict quite differently: either in the type of prediction or even in the number of predictions.

---

### Conditioning

I believe all of these functions are interconnected. In other words, a change in one function likely implies a change in every other function. A change in how the mind observes likely implies a change in how it understands, values, and predicts as well.

We've all had experiences that illustrate this interconnectedness. For example, as you seek truth about a topic and give yourself the time and space to ask probing questions (i.e. put effort into making more and different predictions), you would have noticed that your mind starts to observe things related to your research wherever you look. That your conversations seem to more quickly bend in the direction of your research. That your priorities change

Due to the interconnectedness, I'm going to refer to all 4 functions as conditioning. As I explain more features of conditioning, I hope it'll become clear why this is the most appropriate word to describe the state of these functions of the mind.

### Conditioning can be felt

I believe conditioning is a subconscious force (a "pull") that can be felt when you try to oppose it. For example, someone trained

### Conditioning is a reaction to a want

---

### Conditioning has a notion of depth

---

### Conditioning can be blinding

(Introduce the concept of depth of conditioning)

- (this also means that we are blind to the conditioning itself).
- Map back to the tree search
- If the conditioning is too deeply rooted, it will blind you.
- Schlep blindness.
- Scientific approach blindness.
- Artist blindness.

---

### Conditioning has a useful purpose

The purpose of conditioning from an evolutionary perspective is to enable us to get what we want more quickly. Seeking truth takes time and effort. If you had to seek truth every time you wanted to do something, you'd be incredibly slow.

Conditioning allows you to act without seeking truth.

---

### Conditioning updates in response to satiation

- It's tempting to believe that it's entirely due to past experiences. That if one person

---

### A belief is an addiction

- This is
- This is why intellectually understanding what to do will not enable us to act on it if our conditioning is too difficult to override.

---

### Willpower is the ability to resist conditioning

- The ability to act against conditioning (depending on the depth. The deeper, the more difficult to override with willpower. And the deepest ones, you will not even be able to see, and therefore you will be unable to override it).
- Map back to the tree search.

---

### Memory vs. conditioning

- Define: recall beliefs in the form of thoughts, and to recall the search tree - to remember where you are, and how you got here in the tree.
- Our memory is not as good as we think it is (even in day to day conversations we tend to forget how we got there, or we go deep into unnecessary tangents forgetting the purpose of our conversation in the first place (when there is a purpose ofc). This is the memory function of the mind.
- Map back to the tree search.
- Use the amnesia example.
- Use the reading example.
- Use example of how we often tend to forget the purpose of an experiment or a result. Researchers who often spend years at lower rungs of the tree struggle to explain the purpose of their research to a person who knows nothing about it because they have forgotten and it takes some time to piece it together - even for themselves! Conversations follow the same principle. Memory is incredibly important, else it's easy to get lost in our search for truths.

### How to identify mastery

We shouldn't be quick to judge our ancestors for atrocities they've commited. I mean, of course it's their fault and I'm not trying to shift blame away from them, but if we were had the conditioning of their society, most of us too would have likely been conditioned to believe what they believed. We ought to be more humble about how much we're capable of overriding, and how well.

But this is also great news for those that want to study seeking truth because this means to study mastery you just have to study those that were incredibly unpopular, yet right. The more unpopular they were, the more masterful they had to have been in order to form the right beliefs in an ocean of delusion.

And this also means that mastery can be studied in any domain. E.g. Germans who protected Jewish people during the holocaust, scientists who made groundbreaking research that drew violence from their society. Greats can be found in any area. Unfortunately, they were (and likely are) incredibly scarce. Greats exist in the world today, but it's incredibly difficult to deduce whether someone is great or not - you can only know with greater confidence in hindsight (because we don't know our delusion in the moment).

And any great, is a great truth seeker by definition. They sought truth against and did not allow their outdated conditioning to prevent them from seeing reality as it is.

The world does not incentivize you to become a master. You'd end up being too different for the modern world. Too out of reach. Too difficult to comprehend. And it likely means that whatever status you would get will arrive well after you die. Therefore it requires a massive ego to strive for mastery. An ego so large that you're willing to wait till after death to receive the status you deserve, yet cannot enjoy.

But, that too is changing actually. Since the rate of seeking truth is rising exponentially, you can strive to be a master and enjoy the fruits of your mastery in this life itself. And therefore, we should hopefully see more masters becuase it requires less of an ego than earlier.

(Also, some note about how ego isn't a problem imo. It's the lack of ability to seek truth that's the problem - and the more ambitious you are, the higher integrity you have).

There's another case to identify:

- Someone who is perceived great at one point in life, that ends up doing things incredibly unpopular later on, and perhaps is ostracized as a result. (Einstein). Actually, now that I think about it, this might not be a good heuristic. There may be too many false positives here.
