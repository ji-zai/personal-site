title: Seeking truth is the only skill

I started writing this essay to get a sense for what the most valuable skills will be in a future in which AI becomes incredibly powerful. As I spent more time exploring this question I realized that any valuable skill, at its core, is either a process of seeking the truth about the world we live in, or about ourselves. 

And I believe even that distinction (internal vs. external) is only intellectual. Our ability to seek truth about the world we live in is directly, greatly, impacted by our ability to seek truth about ourselves. After all, your mind is your lens into the world; you can't trust it without understanding it.

As AI becomes more powerful, the ability to seek truth will be the only skill that matters.
## I) Seeking truth
### What does "seeking truth" mean?

By "truth" I mean some property or rule we can observe about a system that exists in reality.

By "system", I mean anything that has some phenomena, or things happening in it. It doesn't matter whether you can observe those things or not. Before we had the microscope we couldn't observe the microscopic properties of biological systems, but those properties of course existed.

The world we live in is made of such systems: physical, biological, chemical, etc.

By "seeking truth", I mean the quest to understand the properties / rules of any system. 

I love the word "seek" because I think it perfectly encapsulates a truth about seeking truth: it is a process of iteration that can only better approximate the reality of a system, without ever reaching it. If you ever reach complete understanding of a system, you've "found" truth, which is clearly far from being the case for most, if not all, systems we've encountered in nature.
### What's the point of seeking truth? 

Well, if you have no wants, and are perfectly content with everything, there would be no point to seeking truth.

Two characteristics of our minds gives purpose to seeking truth: we want, and we want to get what we want as quick as possible.

The things we want are part of systems, and so, the more quickly we can seek truths about the systems that govern our wants, the more quickly we can get what we want. (note: even curiosity, a want to simply uncover truths about a system, is still a want).

Understanding how a system works gives you power over it, because more often than not it means you can get what you want from it, more quickly.

Technically, time is the only thing that is scarce for us. All other resources are only scarce to the extent that we don't yet sufficiently understand the systems that govern those resources to be able to extract them efficiently.

(note: time is not scarce because we will die someday, but rather because of the second characteristic of the mind: to want to get what it wants as quickly as possible. Even if we solve aging somehow, time will still be scarce for us as a result of this nature of our minds).

Our visible universe has an abundance of energy, water, and any other resource that we depend on. Seeking truth is how we will learn to extract these resources such that they are no longer scarce for us.
### Clearly seeking truth is valuable. But is it a skill?

Firstly, what makes something a skill?


### What is the role of luck?
### Not all truths are created equal.
### Skill in seeking truth compounds.
### It's a generalizable skill.
### Is there an upper limit to how good you can be at seeking truth?
### What stops us from seeking truth optimally?
### Self-delusion is the greatest obstacle to being great at seeking truth.

## II) Self-delusion is the greatest delusion
### The mind operates in two modes: thinking & feeling.

### Thinking is grounded in feeling.

### Sensitivity is how much you're aware of what you're feeling.
This implies that there's some feelings that are happening that you can't feel right now.
### You feel a lot more than you think you do.
- There are probably studies out there that measure the feelings a person has (measured on body), vs. what they think they feel. Reference them.
- Talk about my personal experience: the more sensitive I've made my mind, the more I see what I'm feeling, and I can say confidently that there have been many moments in the past when I felt that I was "balanced" or not aggravated or feeling anything, I was extremely self-deluded. (Key moment: when someone says calm down and I scream back "I'm calm!" - no one's stupid enough to really believe that in hindsight, yet we all have the tendency to say that - clearly self-deluded in the moment).
### Feelings are where our biases are held.
### Our feelings hold us back from seeking truth.
- Impatience is rooted in feeling.
- Procrastination is rooted in feeling.
- Lying ( / fraud) is rooted in feeling.

To be clear, I don't mean that feeling itself is useless. I actually don't think it's possible (or at least I haven't yet experienced) to feel absolutely nothing. There's always some feeling, so it's a matter of what feelings are more aligned with seeking truth?

In my personal experience, I've found a feeling of calm and compassion to be the most productive feelings to cultivate. Why? Because they help me see the grander purpose of what I'm doing, who I'm working for, and what my work could enable in others.

It's in this peace that I'm able to be more free in my imaginations and thinking.

For example, I'm willing to bet that if Einstein was constantly wound up and agitated over getting some award or being recognized, he wouldn't have done great research.

My hunch is that he had to be sufficiently balanced to give space to the seemingly tame, random questions about how the world works to even enter his mind.

Many people talk about the "flow" state of mind when they're fully absorbed in the work they're doing. If you think back to when you were in that state, would you characterize it as intense and agitated or more relaxed and at peace - as if the work was happening on its own? I'd bet the latter.

So it's not feeling that's the issue, it's certain feelings that more intensely cloud our view of reality that's the issue.
### Collective delusion compounds exponentially.

- There is a beautiful equation here that demonstrates the exponential nature of increase in delusion when you add an additional member to the team.
- There is also a point to be made about the "weakest link": one sufficiently self-deluded teammate can bring the entire team down.
### Bias != intuition. (TODO: seek truth about this)

## III) Why seeking truth is the only skill
### Seeking truth doesn't generalize fully, but only to the medium of observation.

I was wrong above when I said that skill in seeking truth generalizes to any system. It only generalizes to the medium of observation.
### Seeking truth well requires seeking truth in both mediums: thinking and feeling.
### Exponential rise in technology will make seeking truth the only skill that remains.
### All valuable skills are derived from seeking truth.
### "Truth seeker" is the most robust identity.
### AI will show us what makes us human.
### How do we create a truth seeking world?
