title: Seeking truth is the only skill
date: March 2024

I started writing this essay to get a sense for what the most valuable skills will be in a future in which AI becomes incredibly powerful. As I spent more time exploring this question I realized that any valuable skill, at its core, is either a process of seeking the truth about the world we live in, or about ourselves. 

And I believe even that distinction (internal vs. external) is only intellectual. Our ability to seek truth about the world we live in is directly, greatly, impacted by our ability to seek truth about ourselves. After all, your mind is your lens into the world; you can't trust it without understanding it.

By "truth" I mean some property or rule we can observe about a system that exists in reality.

By "system", I mean anything that has some phenomena, or things happening in it. It doesn't matter whether you can observe those things or not. Before we had the microscope we couldn't observe the microscopic properties of biological systems, but those properties of course existed.

By "seeking truth", I mean the quest to understand the properties / rules of any system. 

I love the word "seek" because I think it perfectly encapsulates a truth about seeking truth: it is a process of iteration that can only better approximate the reality of a system, without ever reaching it. If you ever reach complete understanding of a system, you've "found" truth, which is clearly far from being the case for most, if not all, systems we've encountered in nature.

What's the point of seeking truth? Well, if you have no wants, are perfectly content what what you have and what you understand about the world and yourself, there would be no point to seeking truth.

Two characteristics of our minds gives purpose to seeking truth: we want, and we want to get what we want as quick as possible.

The things we want are part of systems, and so, the more quickly we can seek truths about the systems that govern our wants, the more quickly we can get what we want.

Even curiosity is a want: wanting to understand a system with no other purpose than understanding it. But even those that are curious would prefer to understand a system more  quickly if possible.

But, more often than not, the purpose of seeking truth is to gain power over a system, so that you can get what we want from it, as quickly as you can. 

And so when you decide to become better at seeking truth, all it means is that you want to seek truth faster than you can right now. (note: time is our only scarcity not because we will die, but because of the second characteristic of the mind: wanting what we want as quick as possible).

So clearly seeking truth is valuable. But is it a skill?

Something is a skill when there's some notion of "goodness" to it: i.e. one way of doing it is better than another. And in the case of seeking truth, "well" is simply how quickly you can seek truths about a system.

To make talking about seeking truth easier, let's define "delusion" as the exact opposite of a "truth". "Uncovering a truth" about a system == "Reducing delusion" about a system such that the degree of delusion reduced is proportional to how much the truth tells you about the system.

(Show this to be true with a simple, contrived example of a system and two strategies).

But, of course this example was a contrived system to illustrate that there is skill to seeking truth. In nature, systems are incredibly messy. Not knowing the output for an input is simply one of the many kinds of delusions we can have about a system.

Understanding all the ways we can be deluded about a system helps us have a more granular, more accurate understanding of what seeking truth even means.

Our delusions about a system often manifest through:
- Inaccuracies in how we represent truths.
- Observation inaccuracies in the tools we use to observe a system.
- Overly limiting (or isolated) view of a system.
- Inaccuracies in what you think you already know, and / or the degree of confidence you have in uncovered truths.
- Inaccuracies in how we communicate 

We often represent truths using formal language such as English, math, code, etc. These are inherently only approximations of the truth - and often severely lacking approximations at that.

For example, if you try to describe "basketball" to someone using English statements, could you ever compile a list of such statements that perfectly communicates the meaning of a "basketball" to someone with no knowledge of it, such that after they read the list they have the exact understanding you have about "basketball"? It's impossible.

The level of detail in reality is far greater than the level of detail that can be represented in language. This difference is the inherent inaccuracy in how we represent truths. (note: but of course most of us do a lot worse than the theoretical limit in the level of detail language can represent because we don't utilize language well).

If we design a contrived system to escape the limitations of language, well, then that system itself may not be correlated with reality in meaningful enough ways to be useful. But, this is usually the best we can do.

Anyone looking to seek truth will have to take these (and many more) inaccuracies and incorrect assumptions into account when seeking truth.

But, in my own experience, and based on what I've seen in the world, I believe the deadliest cause for our delusion about the systems we study is our **self-delusion**: our lack of understanding in the way our minds work and all the ways in which our minds cloud our view of reality.

I believe this is the reason we fail to see some of the most obvious, profound truths - which are often right under our noses.

And why when someone makes a profound discovery, it often seem stupidly obvious in hindsight - whether it's an idea for a company, movie, scientific discovery, or anything transformative.

It's not that the truth was kept hidden and required great difficulty to excavate, but that our minds were too clouded to see it sitting right under our noses, even if we were trying to find it; especially if we were trying to find it.

You can have the most accurate tools, more accurate references, most accurate account of what you already know, but if you fail to be able to see reality as it is, then the most fundamental tool you use to understand the world is itself unreliable.

What exactly are we deluded about regarding ourselves that leads us to be deluded about the systems we study? What causes it? And can we overcome it?

In order to answer these questions, I propose a theory of mind that I think is sufficiently accurate based on my own experiences and observation of others, in order to try and make sense of self-delusion in a useful way, that doesn't just treat it as some abstract philosophical concept. I link to any relevant research for the claims that I make. *(note: In no way did I "come up" with this. There are many, many theories of mind from all parts of the world, in probably all time periods of human history. This is just what I think is the simplest, most useful way to look at the mind for the purpose of understanding what seeking truth means, that I've found reasonably accurate based on my observations. There are likely more fundamental truths of the mind that is more aligned with reality.).*

The mind has two modes: it thinks and it feels.

Thinking can be through language or audiovisual imagination. (note: you could also argue that language itself is an imagination which wouldn't change the observations below).
Examples:
- Your inner monologue: your voice (note: or rather, what you think is your voice) that you hear speak in your mind.
- Imagining a painting, diagram, picture, a visual scene of something happening.
- Imagining sounds (that may go along with a visual scene, or on its own).

A feeling is grounded in your body in the form of sensations.
There are all sorts of degrees of intensity for a feeling. And it can come in all shapes and forms that may even be indescribable.

Even an "intuition" is a feeling because, by definition, it is an understanding of something without the need for conscious reasoning, and therefore it falls outside of the realm of thinking.

A feeling has a higher level of detail (i.e. higher "resolution") than thinking, which is why you cannot fully encapsulate a feeling using thinking.

I'm not at all claiming that this somehow makes feeling superior to thinking. In a way, the loss of level of detail of thinking is its strength: it's in the loss that each individual fills the remaining meaning through feeling. If we could represent feeling with full accuracy, then we'd be able to communicate it to others without any loss of information, and there would be no room for unique individual experiences. Lower resolution is also more efficient. This is likely why language and text dominate human communication. It's a necessity.

All I'm saying is that thinking and feeling are fundamentally different modes of operation that are deeply connected. And that understanding how to seek truth requires understanding how these modes interact with each other.

Thinking is accompanied by feeling. Our thinking affects our feelings, and our feelings affect our thinking.

Many of us know the feeling of sending someone that we love a message when we were angry only to later regret it once our mind settled from the anger.

If we could rewind back to that moment and could somehow fully replace the feeling of anger with the feeling of love, then we most definitely wouldn't have worded the message in that way. And most likely, we wouldn't have even had that wording which was infused with anger, even arise as a thought in our mind.

It's as if certain feelings (like anger) can cause temporary delusion that makes us not see the reality of the situation: that we're talking to someone we love deeply and that it is simply a misunderstanding that has many productive ways to deal with that doesn't cause a rift.

On the other hand, feelings like compassion seem to settle the mind into a state of greater peace, that enables us to see the reality of the situation more clearly and act in a way that gets us what we want from that situation.

And there's also a degree to which we can be deluded by certain feelings.

An extreme example: no one would be able to say "I wish you were dead" to someone they loved without their feeling of anger cloud their view of reality to a great degree.

Therefore, it's clear that some feelings have the power to warp our perception of reality such that we're not able to see it clearly, because if we could in that moment, then we wouldn't do what that "warped" version of ourselves did.

And there's a timeline to the delusion as well. With enough time it seems to settle. The more intense the delusion, the more time it takes to settle. We regret what we've done only after our minds settle from the intense feeling, and we can look back at what we did more objectively.

I also believe we feel far less than we're capable of feeling. Artists call this "sensitivity", to refer to how acutely aware you are to what you're feeling in any given moment in time.

Your sensitivity is how well you can observe your own feelings at any given point in time. The more sensitive you are, the more subtle feelings you can perceive.

In the previous example of sending someone an angry message, if you don't have strong sensitivity, you'll likely not be able to perceive the rise in anger up to its peak. You'll look back at it and only remember a sharp rise to the peak and the fall, but not the subtle rise and the lingering subtle anger that lasts well after the fall, even when you think it's fully subsided.

(TODO: a graph. y: "feeling intensity", x: "time". Show the sine wave curve of the rising and falling of feeling. Draw a y-intercept to show what your sensitivity is, you can only perceive what is above that sensitivity)

Your sensitivity also correlates with your ability to feel what another person is going through (i.e. empathy) (todo: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22957393/#:~:text=In%20view%20of%20empathy%20it,of%20the%20other%20persons%20feeling.).

When you see someone feeling an emotion, mirror neurons in your brain trigger the feeling that it thinks the other person is feeling into your own mind.

Therefore, the more sensitive you are to your own feelings, the more sensitive you will be to others' feelings.

To add:
- Reducing stress isn't just to make you more "productive" in the traditional sense of working more hours, etc. but also because it enables you to be a better truth seeker. And the more technological leverage we have, the more critical the skill to be at ease will become. You need to be more calm to be able to observe reality as it is.
- Truth seeking skill is generalizable to the same medium (and give explanation: )
- In the conclusion, double down on the fact that I could be severely deluded.
- An interesting product idea: more accurately measure what you're feeling (through sensors) and alert you when your mind is to compromised to do objective study - based on what you define that level to be, and ofc needs to be crazy private.
- This way of seeing truth seeking shows that artists and scientists aren't really that different in the way they operate; they only differ in the medium in which they seek truth. An artist leans towards seeking truths about the human condition of feelings, and the scientist seeks truth in our external world through thinking. But even these difference fade away as you look at the highest caliber of artist or scientist: they converge into truth seeking across both mediums because it's not possible to do great work without excelling at seeking truth in both mediums, as they are deeply intertwined. An artist must still express that feeling through thinking as there is no other way to share it with another. And a scientist must be in tune with their feelings such that they can tell apart which feeling is an incorrect bias that will hold them back, and which feeling is a "hand of God" that will propel them forward in their research. In the upper echelons of human potential, there is only seeking truth. No distinctions exist, and if they do, are only a result of our clouded vision as a consequence of our self-delusions. Perhaps that's why the greats enjoyed each others' company so much: they found deep similarity as opposed to the deep divide the rest of the world conjured.
	- Einstein: "The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant."
	- (There are incredible quotes here from greats across all disciplines.)
- When we take self-delusion into account and give it the importance it deserves, we ought to work to find ways to reduce our individual and collective delusions. (Transition to training truth seeking, and building truth seeking teams and larger organizations).
	- And the solution can't simply be to reward outcomes more. An overly intense pressure on outcomes can cloud judgement as well. See what happens when you try to do something impatiently, in a rush.
- No one is immune to self-delusion. Even the best doctors. Even the best companies (Google sleeping on AI).
- (Relevant link: academic fraud: )
- You may think that the worst part about this delusion is being fraudulent. I actually think that's the least of our worries. The worst part is that most human efforts are mediocre at best as a consequence of being self-deluded.

- And we're terrible at keeping our self-delusions locked up in ourselves. When we meet others we inadvertently, often subconsciously, try to get them to be self-deluded in the same ways we are.
- Meanwhile, the limit for how much power we can gain in the system is limited only by the degree to which there is order in the system. If everything happens randomly, all the time, 
- Even if you don't believe it's the only skill, but see that it's important you'll want to get better at it.
- Seeking truth turns from a passion to being useful based on how badly you want something. Fundamentally,
- Reducing our delusion about a system also reduces our degrees of choice in the system. In the most extreme case, if you perfectly understand a system, the only thing you can change is what you want out of that system. You'll know what is possible and what is impossible, and you'll be forced to change your want to something you know is possible to even get (or you're insane).
- Meanwhile, the limit for how much power we can gain in the system is limited only by the degree to which there is order in the system. If everything happens randomly, all the time, 

Cut:
- , because any unnoticed biases in our minds makes it more difficult for us to see reality as it is in our external worlds.

The value of seeking truth is grounded in the intensity of your wants. It's only when you want something out of a system that seeking the truth about it becomes valuable as it gives you greater power to get what you want out of that system.

That want could even be as simple as wanting to understand the system with no other purpose.

The nature of the human mind is to want, and to get what it wants as quickly as possible. And as a result of the second characteristic, time is our only scarcity. (note: Time is not scarce because we will not exist someday, but a consequence of this characteristic of our mind. Therefore even if we somehow solve aging, time will still be scarce.).

There is nothing else that we can say is "scarce" because, technically, we can see abundance in every other thing we care about: material resources, energy, etc. We just don't know how to extract things we value efficiently from those abundant resources. And we can learn how to do that by seeking truths about the systems that govern those resources.

So, only when you want something from a system will you want to seek the truths about it. And how intensely you want those wants will influence how intensely you want to know the truths about it.
