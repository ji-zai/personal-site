title: Seeking truth is the only skill
date: April 2024
---
To seek truth is to understand the realities of the world we live in so that we can get what we want from it.

It's always been an important process for us, yet the majority of us didn't need to do this in order to be able to live somewhat comfortable lives. There were a variety of activities that were possible in order to contribute to our families and society.

Soon, I believe seeking truth will be the only thing we have left to do.

This essay is my attempt to understand what seeking truth actually means with all the nuance and precision required to see what matters, understand how the world is changing and what that means for us.

What is a truth?

A truth is a reality of a system. A system is anything that has some phenomena happening inside of it. Physics, biology, chemistry, are all systems with varying events, characteristics and rules that govern them.

Because a truth is aligned with reality, it exists whether someone observes it, understands it, or even agrees with it. Gravity exists regardless of what anyone thinks about it.

For now, let’s think of a truth as a statement that’s represented by a sequence of English characters. A statement is true to the degree that it’s aligned with reality.

It’s possible for me to believe a statement is true, even though it's not aligned with reality. Let’s call this gap, our “delusion”. Our delusion is the difference between what we think the truth is, and what the truth actually is.

And so seeking truth is the process of understanding a system as it exists in reality / reducing our delusion about a system.

The word “seek” means “try to find”. I think this describes the process of seeking truth well. Seeking truth only gets you closer to the truth. We’ve yet to “find” the truth about any naturally occurring system, and from what we can tell, we understand very, very little of what is possible to understand. There is always more truth to be uncovered.

Why seek truth?

The nature of our minds dictates that we want things, and we want to get what we want as quickly as possible.

And therefore, time is the only resource that is scarce for us. It's not scarce because we will die, but because we want to get what we want as quickly as possible. Even if we solve aging, time will continue to be a scarcity for us.

Seeking truth isn’t useful if you don’t want things and want to get what you want as quickly as possible. If you want something and don’t care when you’ll get it, and if you have infinite time, then you can simply try random things and you’ll eventually get what you want.

But if you care about getting what you want quickly, you’ll need to understand the systems that govern what you want so that you can work more productively to get what you want as quickly as possible.

Therefore, seeking truth gives you power to get what you want.

(note: even curiosity is a want: a want to understand something simply for the sake of understanding it. Even those that are curious would want to understand something as quickly as they can, and therefore seeking truth would be valuable to them as well.)

From the perspective of our species, all resources that are currently scarce for humans, except time, exist in abundance in the universe: energy, the components that make water, food, light, etc.

And so, the only that prevents us from solving all of humanity's problems (note: external) is our lack of understanding of the systems that govern these resources. And we gain that understanding by seeking truth.

So clearly seeking truth is incredibly valuable. Our progress as a species is grounded in our ability to seek truth about the world we live in, and about ourselves.

But, I think we're far from being as good as we can be at seeking truth. If there is such a thing as optimal truth seeking, which I believe exists as we'll explore later, then we are orders of magnitude away from where we could be.

We're so far from our potential because we don't culturally prioritize truth seeking to the extent that we could, and, more importantly, because most of us don't understand (even intellectually) what seeking truth even means with sufficient nuance and precision that's required to become great at it.

(note: This essay surprised me because of how much I learned about seeking truth by seeking the truth about it through writing. If I was close to the average person in the world in terms of my understanding of seeking truth before writing this essay, and just slightly above average after writing this, then I believe we have a lot, lot of room for improvement)

A truth has a sense of value.

From nature's perspective, things just exist, and value is a feature of a being that wants something. If you have no wants, there's no sense to value one truth over another.

How you value a truth depends on what you want. The value corresponds to how much you believe that truth will enable you to get what you want.

Therefore, you'd value one truth more than another if it gets you more of what you want, more quickly.

Predictive power and relevance determine a truth's value.

Predictive power is how much that truth tells about the systems that govern your want, in a way that enables you to act on it.

There are two aspects to this predictive power: fundamentality, and precision.

For someone building a bridge, the truth about the formula for gravity is far more valuable than the truth: "when you throw something up, it will fall back down".

From the perspective of this engineer, both are true, but the formula for gravity tells them a lot more about the system they're operating in. They're able to predict how the system will behave without having to see that behavior.

They can tell a lot more because they can derive a variety of behaviors from the formula for gravity. A truth is more fundamental the more things that can be derived from it.

The know what forces will act on the bridge and can therefore plan for it without having to go through the process of building something that doesn't work, having it break, and then learning from it. This is invaluable.

For a truth to have power, it also needs to be precise. Precision is having enough detail to be actionable.

For example: "Ai is going to greatly change the world" is far weaker of a truth than knowing exactly how it will impact the world, in which ways. The person that believes the former may lead the person to learn more about AI, and perhaps make a few good long term investments. A person that knows the latter will be able to help build the future of AI.

In a way, precision is required for a truth to be fundamental as well. An overly generic truth can't be used to derive anything from it. So these are different ways of describing what at the end of the day is simply predictive power.

Yet, a powerful truth is useless to someone if it doesn't help them get what they want, i.e. it's not relevant to them.

For a person in a village who desperately needs to build a boat to get across a large body of water, e = mc^2 isn't valuable at all, even though it is an incredibly powerful truth that tells a lot about the world we live in.

Therefore, relevancy is critical for a person to value a truth.

Another way to look at it is:
- Relevancy is how aligned it is with your want.
- Power is the magnitude of the truth.

It may seem that the way a person values a truth is purely subjective, and changes from person to person. That is mostly true, but there is objectivity to this as well.

Two people with the same want, with sufficient time to seek truth about the systems that govern their want, will eventually converge towards the same values for truths pertaining to those systems.

For example, world leaders who want to keep their countries safe would all value greatly the truths about how nuclear weapons operate.

Therefore, from here on out, I'll refer to the "true value" of a truth for a given want to be the value that someone who has the want, and a complete understanding of all the systems that govern that want, would assign to this truth.

It's easy to see how the "true value" often differs from the value we associate with a truth.

For example (show an example of someone who discovers something for the first time thinks it's a game changing breakthrough, that is stupidly valuable, but it's only after you discover something more powerful that you learn to put the previously highly valued truth in its place. Or even better: what seems like an unnecessary truth today, may actually be an incredibly valuable once sufficient understanding ripens in adjacent systems).

And we've found in practice that the values of truths follow the power law: the most valuable truths are orders of magnitudes more valuable than the least valuable ones. (note: may need to substantiate this a bit more).

(Todo: patience definitely has a role to play in the value function. If you're being chased by a tiger and all you want is to find a way to escape, only the truths that enable immediate escape are valued, and all values for all other truths go down to 0 for as long as you feel like your life is in danger - def need to find a way to work this into the model).

There's also a sense of similarity between two truths.

For a person who wants to get across a lake, the truths: "wood floats on water", and "a sail can propel with wind", are far more similar than the truth "gold sinks in water" is with either of them.

Why is that? Because a person who wants to get across a body of water is probably not going to predict something about the floating nature of gold in water, as it's so unrelated to what they want. Similarly, they wouldn't predict the kind of insects that live in the wood after they understand "wood floats on water".

In other words, the similarity between two truths is the likelihood of you predicting one as a reaction to the understanding of the other.

Similarity doesn't seem to fully depend on the value the truths. You won't always predict truths that are valuable, and more often than not you'll predict a bunch of truths that are useless before you start to predict more useful ones. 

So similarity(t1, t2) and value(t) seem to be independent functions.

Similarity also impacts what you observe, because an observation can be a reaction to a prediction, and so if the similarity function determines prediction, it will impact observation since you'll only create experiments for what you predict. (note: what about the observation that is a direction reaction to a want and not a prediction?)

This similarity function creates "clusters" of truths. Therefore, as you seek truth, you'll tend to understand it in clusters.

Over time, as you understand more of the systems that govern your want, you'll realize that some clusters are much closer than you initially thought they were. (todo: show a good example for this).

Similar to the value function, there is a sense of objectivity to the similarity function, or in other words there's a "true similarity" between two truths, for a given want.

Two individuals with the same want, given infinite time to seek truth, will eventually converge on the same similarity function.

They'd have no choice but to see the similarity between two truths that initially seemed far apart if those two truths work together to help them get what they want.

For example, most people thought that the truths about rubber and metal were two "far apart" clusters of truths until we invented tools and materials that utilized both (like car tires). 

Then, they became more similar truths. When someone thinks about how to use rubber to get what they want, they're now more likely to think about the truths about metals as a way to reinforce the rubber in more useful ways. (todo: there's definitely a better example, but this conveys the gist of what I'm trying to get at).

We live life with an internal model of what we believe is true, and this model influences how we act in the world. We act according to our model in order to get the things that we want.

For now, let's think of this model as a spreadsheet with many rows, each corresponding to a truth you believe in.

Each row would have the following columns:
1. Your truth (a statement).
2. Confidence (how much you believe that your truth is actually aligned with reality).
3. Value (how much you value this truth, as we discussed above).

To help make sense of this model, let's give each field a range of values it can take:
- Let's say that "your truth" is just a statement written in English / mathematical characters.
- Let's say that "confidence" ranges from 0 to 1, such that 0 = no confidence, 1 = so confident that you'd be willing to bet your life on this truth.
- Let's say that "value" can be any positive integer value.

This spreadsheet exists in your head. And each row in this spreadsheet also corresponds to a value of "delusion": how mis-aligned that row is from reality.

And there are multiple dimensions in which a row can be mis-aligned: 

The degree to which what you believe to be true isn't true.
And the degree to which your value of a truth is different from its true value.

Delusion lives outside of your model, i.e. outside of your head. If you could see what you're deluded about at this moment in time, then it's not a delusion for you as you know what it is.

For now, let's say "delusion" ranges from 0 to 1, such that 0 = no delusion, meaning that what you believe is the truth is perfectly aligned with reality (i.e. your truth is THE truth).

(note: show an elegant image showing the model in a mind, and the delusion existing outside of that mind as the gap between the mind and reality).

Delusion can only be understood in hindsight: after you've removed yourself of the delusion, you can better see how it existed in the past, and the nature of what it was (i.e. to what extent you were deluded about what things).

Your model gives you power. The more powerful your model is, the better you understand the systems that govern what you want in that moment, and the more you get of what you want, more quickly.

And the power of your model is the power of all of your truths - i.e. each row in this spreadsheet that we're using to represent the model:

Power of row = (value)(confidence)(1 - delusion).
The power of the model is the sum of the powers for each row.

Why this formula?

If you believe in a truth that is valuable (i.e. relevant to your want, and powerful), and you have high confidence in it, then you have greater power because you can predict more about the systems that govern your want, and therefore are more able to get what you want.

If you believe in a truth with low confidence, you have less power because you're less able to act on it as you're unsure whether it's actually true. The higher the cost of acting on it, the more you'll need to increase your confidence somehow before you can act on it.

(todo: give a good example here)

The (1 - delusion) exists as a penalty for being for being mis-aligned with reality. The more deluded you are, the less power you have.

If you have high confidence in your truth, but your truth isn't close to reality, then you'll have a more difficult time getting what you want.

A person that wants to build a bridge across a river that believes that gravity exerts no force on the bridge is extremely deluded and any bridge they build is likely to collapse as a result.

Therefore, seeking truth is to increase the power of your model so that you can get what you want more quickly.

And how would you do that?
1. Increase value.
2. Increase confidence.
3. Reduce delusion.

The way we've defined this model is inaccurate in some ways. As we explore the process in which this model gets updated, we'll be in a better position to improve it. For now it's directionally right in the sense that increasing value, confidence and decreasing delusion builds a more powerful model.

Delusion is a critical piece of this equation. Without taking delusion into account, anyone could simply believe their truth had higher value than it actually does, or increase their confidence in it randomly, leading to a more powerful model.

Unfortunately, there is a great penalty for delusion that makes this a difficult way to increase the power of your model.

To be clear, the power of your model has nothing to do with whether you can explain why you believe what you do. If it's truly high value, you have high confidence, with minimal delusion, you have a powerful model that will enable you to get what you want more quickly, and easily, regardless of whether you can explain it.

(note: some of the most successful people (in terms of being able to get what they want), would fail to explain well enough why they believe what they do about the world and themselves.)

For example, Ramanujan pulling profound theories from "God" that all happened to be right. He didn't even get around to proving most before he died. Those that simply have a feel for things, and that feel happens to be true. They may try to explain things after the fact, but that explanation is constructed, not what they actually used to have high skill.

We learn by observing, understanding, and predicting.

To observe is to consciously perceive something happening. You can perceive this through any of your senses: see, hear, taste, feel, smell, or thinking (i.e. observing a thought).

To understand is to update your model according to an observation.
This update could involve changing a truth (i.e. the statement that represents a truth), changing your confidence in a truth, or changing how much you value a truth. And this update could impact multiple rows in your model.

To predict is to make guesses about truths that can't be directly inferred by what you've observed.

These guesses are stored in your model just like any other truth. They simply differ in that they have lower confidence. After all, a guess with a high confidence isn't really a guess.

When you observe something, your mind starts trying to understand it.

When you understand something (i.e. you've updated your model to reflect it), your mind starts to predict what else is likely to be true given this understanding.

The mind seems to operate in multiple ways to get to a prediction from understanding. Questions pop up that push you in that direction. You may feel some "intuition" that tugs at you to consciously form a hunch about the world. But regardless of the way to get there, we arrive at a prediction: a truth with some confidence, but not very high confidence because if it were, it wouldn't be a prediction.

And when you predict something to be true, and your mind believes it is high value (i.e. your value function returns a high value), then you'll want to see whether it's actually true, because if it is, you're model will become more powerful.

So, a prediction triggers another want.

But, what triggers an observation? Does it come out of a void? I think it comes from a want.

When we want something, the mind is conditioned to try and notice the things that it believes will help it get what we want, to the degree of the intensity of our want.

For example, ().

This makes a cycle: want -> observe -> understand -> predict.

And since we never stop wanting, we're constantly in this cycle.

This is the fundamental process of seeking truth in order to get what we want. Every one of us goes through this process. Some of it happens consciously, using some systematic method to go from one step to another, but I believe most of it happens unconsciously.

(todo: not sure where to put this, here or later when talking about thinking / feeling: To be clear, this "want to see whether it's actually true" doesn't need to be an actual thought that arises in the mind. Oftentimes we're just led by a feeling to figuring out if something is true.)

---

Another way to look at this process, is that it's a search problem that has many branches. And each branch spawns more branches. It's recursive (link: wiki article).

You start with a want. The want leads to observations that your mind believes can help fulfill that want. Observations leads to understandings, which lead to multiple predictions, and predictions that your mind considers valuable become wants, each with its own sub-cycle.

The mind focuses on one want at a time. The feeling that we can multi-task probably exists because we're not aware of the jumps between wants that the mind is always making - sometimes within a single second.

An interesting example is what I experienced just now: I was typing a word in the above on my laptop, felt some hunger, wanted some food - all while not stopping the typing. And then my mind noticed a spelling mistake in my typing and I wanted to fix it so I hit backspaces and re-wrote it.

Even in this small window of typing a word, my stomach growled, my mind wanted food, and then saw that I made a typo and then jumped back to wanting to fix it. I don't think those wants happened simultaneously. But if they didn't, how did my fingers keep typing while I was wanting something else other than to write the next word? I think because we can do things mindlessly without wanting, just how we can drive a car without actively, consciously wanting.

The presence of mindless action that is fulfilling a previous want doesn't disprove that the mind can only want one thing at a time. But even if you believe otherwise (that there are multiple "threads"), understanding how a single thread operates should at least be directionally illuminating.
