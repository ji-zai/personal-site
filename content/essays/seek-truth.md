The ability to seek truth is the most valuable skill for a founder.

Seeking truth enables you to make better decisions, manage stress more effectively, be more productive, think longer term, and be more ambitious.

And importantly, any worthwhile human creation is constructed on some truth: about the world, or mind. Doing great work requires the ability to seek truth.

As AI improves exponentially fast, the value of truth seeking rises in tandem. 

And fortunately, it's a skill that can be trained.

To understand truth seeking, we need to understand delusion.

Truth seeking only matters if you're deluded in some way, because if you're not deluded, it implies you can see reality clearly. I can assure that you, me, and everyone else out there are significantly deluded about the realities of the world and our own minds.

## You’re deluded

Your conscious mind and subconscious mind are in opposition with each other. They want different things for you.

By definition, what happens in the conscious mind are all the things that you can perceive such as the thoughts you think, strong emotions, etc. and what happens in the subconscious is invisible to the conscious mind.

For most of us, what our conscious mind wants are the usual things: i.e. to do good for the world, put the team’s success above our own, peace and harmony, etc.

But all our subconscious mind cares about is self-preservation [x], and in modern world, this  manifests as a craving for external validation and status. It’s hardwired deep into our psyche as part of evolution.

Your conscious mind needs internal consistency to have self-respect and feel like it’s sane. Your subconscious knows this, which is why it needs to hide its cravings from your conscious mind. It warps your perception of reality to make your conscious mind believe you’re putting the team above you, while deep down in the subconscious layers, you’re actually optimizing for getting your face on the cover of Forbes.

Your conscious mind is deluded by your subconscious mind (i.e. you’re deluding yourself all the time).

It’s quite easy to spot this contradiction and delusion in others because their subconscious mind can’t warp your perception, so you can see how they’re enslaved by their subconscious. They say they want to do one thing, but you can see that their actions directly contradict the desires they’ve voiced.

But you’re just as inconsistent, delusional and enslaved by your subconscious as you see others to be, if not worse. It’s just a lot more difficult to see your own delusions because of how effective your subconscious is at warping your perception.

When you get a glimpse of what’s happening in your subconscious, you’ll puke. It’ll be disgusting. Atrocious. You’re not what you think you are. And you’re definitely not what you tell the world you are.

While your conscious mind dreams of fixing education, your subconscious dreams of adding “forbes_x_under_x”, or “some_status_symbol” in your Twitter bio.

While your conscious mind dreams of building tools that empower the billions around the world, your subconscious dreams of being on Lex’s podcast chatting about how you changed the world.

The more you dig, the more crap comes up. Keep a bucket close by.

**You are everything you hate in others, 10x’ed.**

## Self-delusion keeps you from succeeding

All of your mistakes and failures stem from how deluded your conscious mind is about what’s actually happening in your subconscious.

You might be wondering why I’ve been so fixated on the internal reality of your own mind rather reality of the external world. After all, for your startup to succeed, you’ll need to build a product that is aligned with the reality of the external world you’re operating in.

Our delusions about the external world stem from our internal delusions.

Reduce internal delusion and you’ll find you’re able to see the external world more clearly.

Your subconscious prevents you from seeing solutions that it believes will be too painful for you. After all, that’s its job: self-preservation.

Therefore when faced with a situation, if you’re not careful, your subconscious mind will make a decision for you by choosing the least painful option. 

You either won’t even know that you made the decision, or if it’s a decision you have to actively communicate to others about, then you’ll “feel” this subconscious pull towards a particular decision and then your conscious mind will come up with some plausible sounding narrative to maintain its internal consistency.

For example, for someone with a fear of, say, large social gatherings, will find that their lives unfold in a way that conveniently avoids large social gatherings without the thought “I’m avoiding large social gatherings because of my social fear” even arising in their mind.

This is why when you ask an engineer who spent 3 months building a feature whether we should cut it since it doesn’t fit with the new product roadmap, they’re very likely to try and justify keeping the feature because it’s incredibly painful to throw away hard work like that.

This is an example of how the subconscious makes the decision for you, but the conscious mind comes up with a plausible narrative and it appears to you that you’ve made the decision even though it was made for you by your subconscious long before a thought even arose in your conscious mind.

This is why products, codebases, design systems, documentation, etc. get bloated and grow in complexity over time. It’s more painful to cut than it is to add. It’s more painful to take a step back without attachment and revisit how to do things from first principles than it is to just slap on the next thing.

Your delusion impacts not just smaller decisions about adding features, etc, but every single thing you do.

One of the biggest decisions you’ll make in life is choosing what to work on. Most people have a massive blindness towards most possibilities for how to spend your time. Especially the most extreme ones which also happen to be the most interesting.

Your subconscious will literally prevent you from seeing possibilities that it perceives are too difficult, too painful. It will make decisions for you such that your life will unfold without the thought of such possibilities even entering your mind.

The ideas your conscious mind thinks are ambitious are nothing in comparison to the truly ambitious paths that are possible, that you simply cannot see.

So, not only does your delusion prevent you from executing your startup well, it prevents you from even seeing the best ideas to pursue that, by their nature of being the best, are likely to be the most painful.

Delusion also causes great stress as a result of the internal friction between your conscious and subconscious minds.

The way I’ve presented the conscious and subconscious minds as completely separate entities is a lie. They’re tightly coupled.

When the subconscious makes decisions on your behalf, you will act on those decisions. And when you do, there’s some part of you that feels the contradiction between your conscious and subconscious, which expresses as stress in the form of guilt, anxiety, etc.

We all know the feeling of consciously deciding to stick to a diet and somehow find ourselves biting down on a cake our friend brought over, only to feel guilty afterwards for not sticking to what we planned to do.

This same drama plays out for almost every micro decision you make about anything.

When you say you’re making a decision that’s best for the team when in reality it’s because of your subconscious craving for status, even if you’re not consciously aware of that contradiction, you will still experience the stress of that contradiction [x].

Self-delusion adds so much stress without you even realizing it. An unnecessary burden on top of all the usual burdens of starting a company.

## Seeking truth is the only antidote

Seeking truth is the process of seeing, understanding and accepting what’s happening in the subconscious layers of your mind.

It’s like shining a light into your subconscious, bringing some of its activity into your conscious visibility.

You might have noticed that in this definition of seeking truth, there’s nothing about actually changing anything. So, how does seeking truth actually remove delusion?

The crazy thing is, change happens on its own.

The beauty of this process is that when you shed light on your subconscious and brought some of it into your conscious visibility, you’ve created an inconsistency in your conscious mind: you thought you were one thing, but the reality you saw in your subconscious has completely shattered that view.

Your mind HATES internal inconsistencies. In a panic it will try to bridge the gap between what your conscious mind wants to be, and what you actually are.

This is where your ego actually helps you. [x]

To bridge the inconsistency, your mind can either:

1. Become dejected by realizing that you’re not all that you thought you were and give up pursuing your dreams.
2. Or, your mind will force you to rise to become the person you want to be, that you earlier thought you were, but have since realized you are not.

The ego pushes you to take the second path. It pushes you to rise to your ideal self-image.

When equipped with truth, your ego becomes an ally.

The evolution takes time. As you keep seeing the contradiction and feeling the pain it causes you, your can’t help but slowly bridge the gap. It’s like you keep burning your hand on a hot pan for some reason, and you can clearly see it. Over time you’ll eventually stop burning your hand even if there’s a strong pull to touch the pan (for whatever reason). Self-delusion means you can’t see the burning. When you see it, the self-preservation mechanism of your mind will work to minimize the pain of the contradiction.

This doesn’t mean that your subconscious mind will stop optimizing for self-preservation.

When you have better visibility into your subconscious activities, and you’re making a decision, you’ll be able to see that the subconscious wants it for a reason you don’t support, you can take a step back and more carefully evaluate whether that is the right decision because you can sense that your subconscious is craving it. And anything your subconscious craves should worry you because it stems from that source of self-preservation, which is likely at odds with what your conscious mind is optimizing for in that moment.

And by slowly increasing the visibility you have into what’s actually determining your decisions, you’ll act on those subconscious cravings less, and will be able to make better decisions.

## How to seek truth

Truth seeking is a skill that can be trained.

Everyone is unique, so the specific techniques and paths that work best for an individual may not work for another. Yet, I believe there are some common features for truth seeking technique.

Some of it may sound like “mindfulness” or “meditation”, but those words are so loaded that I ask you try and throw away any notion you have about them. There’s nothing going on except you trying to understand what’s happening in your own mind. Let’s leave it at that without trying to label it.

### 1) Truth seeking requires acceptance of delusion

Or at least, accept the possibility that you’re deluded. Because the concept of “seeking truth” makes no sense if you’re not deluded, because that means you already see the truth clearly.

By accepting delusion, you’ve already planted the seed in your conscious mind to be more wary of what you “feel” like doing because there’s clearly a part of you that doesn’t want what you want. 

You’ll question your instincts more. This doesn’t mean you won’t do what you instinctively want to do, but you will have more space to actively make the decision rather than let your subconscious make it for you without your say.

### 2) Truth seeking happens through nonjudgemental observation.

I don’t believe truth seeking can happen in its fullest form while you’re actively consuming information from the world outside. Watching a video, listening to a podcast, or anything that requires your conscious mind to be actively engaged hampers its ability to observe itself.

What this looks like in practice is to turn your attention inwards and observe whatever you see / feel / think without judging anything.

The muscle to observe objectively without judgement is a totally different muscle that is used for actively thinking thoughts. And the objective observation muscle is the one that allows you to see what’s happening without getting caught up in it.

When you actively think thoughts, you’re caught up in the game of the mind. You have to train the mind to take a step back and just check out what’s happening, without even asking why.

You need to watch what’s happening in the same way you can watch people at a party without actively participating in any single discussion. Conversations all around you, people dancing, jumping, loud music, whatever. You’re just taking it all in while doing nothing.

That’s the key. “Doing nothing”. But the muscle to “do nothing” is so underdeveloped that you’ll find doing nothing is fucking tough. But the muscle exists because like any other muscle, the more you do, the better you get.

You have a thought, you recognize the thought is there, and you notice the thought leaving without actively engaging with it. You don’t ask why. You don’t regret having the thought. You don’t try and actively push the thought away because you’re ashamed of it. You have to see it and accept it.

You will of course have the tendency to start engaging with the thought when you observe it, because that’s what you’ve been doing with your conscious mind your entire life. That habit is tough to break.

When your mind inevitably starts engaging with a thought by going down its rabbit hole, gently, without judging yourself or going “oh shit” or having any sort of negative reaction to it, bring it back to just checking out what’s going on. Just observing.

If you struggle to bring yourself back to observing without judging yourself. Say you have an “oh shit I need to get back” reaction, don’t have another one for that reaction.

The mind is like quicksand, it has a tendency to go down vicious cycles. Once the chain reaction starts it can go further than you’d think.

“Oh shit I need to bring my mind back”

“Oh shit, I did it again. Damn.”

“Shit, I think I suck at this. How am I so damn bad at this?”

“I was so reckless today and shipped a bug into production and now I can’t just sit and observe. Why can’t I do anything right?”

“Like, do I even deserve to have the opportunity to build a company?”

“Such utter incompetence”.

“Oh shit, I need to bring my mind back”

You need to find a way to cut that vicious cycle as early as you can. You’ll get better at this as you train the observation muscle.

You could do this in many scenarios. While you go on a walk. You could sit with eyes closed. On a train looking out. Wherever. But the key is to not let the mind grasp onto details in the external world. This is why I tend to choose the sitting and closing eyes option when I can to remove the visual distractions of the world, but it’s also possible to do this with eyes open, just more difficult because there will be more distractions to pull yourself back from. [x]

It’s valuable to practice this in multiple scenarios - eyes open sometimes and eyes closed - because you never know when you’ll find yourself in a position in which you can’t keep your eyes closed (e.g. in a boring lecture in which you don’t want to come off as sleepy).

### 3) Truth seeking takes time. A lot of time. Like… a lot.

And I don’t mean a lot of time as in a lifetime’s work or some something vague. I literally mean you’ll need have to have a long continuous block of time.

To get even a glimpse into 0.000001% of what’s happening in your subconscious, you’ll need to patiently sit and observe for hours. But that little sliver of truth can be incredibly powerful.

I urge you to avoid any tools that present themselves as shortcuts “just 5 mins a day will change your life”. I know, they sound tempting, but they’ll hold you back from truly exploring what’s going on inside. And if you’re with me until now, I hope you at least acknowledge that most of your problems stem from this thing called your mind and that it’s worth trying to get to know what the hell’s happening inside of it.

The value of seeking truth increases exponentially with time (i.e. one hour is not just 12 times more effective than 5 minutes, but an order of magnitude more effective. Why? I think it’s because our subconscious activities are powered by our chemical biological systems (hormone secretion) which doesn’t follow a linear scale).

So if you already have some kind of truth seeking activity you do, I urge you to at least occasionally try longer durations.

### 4) Truth seeking is difficult.

Embrace the fact that understanding what’s going on in your mind will be one of most challenging things you’ll do.

If something starts to feel easy for some reason, be cautious. It could be a trap, a trick to get you to think that you’re done and got all you need from the session.

The most uncomfortable, painful, profound truths often come after the “highs” when you feel like everything’s good. You need to give them time to rise.

This is why I suggest using a timer. Set the time you want and don’t get up even if you feel good and “done” [x].

After that phase when you feel the world is perfect for that moment, some worry, anxiety, or heck, your back pain will kick in. Great! The productive work starts again. Look forward to the difficulties, you’re bound to have them.

- Try your best to be at ease physically. When your body is tense, your subconscious is better at guarding its secrets because it’s operating in flight or fight.
- The difficulty of seeking truth means that most of us would rather choose to distract ourselves by something rather than seek the truth behind our current situation.
    - For example: the vicious procrastination cycle.

### 5) Truth seeking requires (? maybe this goes in above)

Now, I don’t mean actively choosing to do it, that can happen.

Getting truths from your subconscious requires the same compassion, patience as getting other people to open up to you.

If you judge what someone is saying, or brush aside their idea, or tell them it’s stupid, they’re not going to share more things with you obviously.

The same principle applies when coaxing truths out of your subconscious.

You can’t hold it by the neck and ask for it.

When it presents itself though a thought or feeling, you can’t judge it and try to push it away. If you do, well, just like another person, it’s going to stop wanting to share things with you.

The only way to open up is to treat it with compassion and calmly accept whatever it shares with you. Make it comfortable. Treat it as a friend.

### 6) Truth seeking cannot happen in autopilot (it should not become mechanical).

It’s easy to fall into the trap of doing things robotically, out of habit, like a routine.

Those who drive often don’t consciously perceive that they’re driving. They just do it out of habit.

Much of life ends up turning into a mindless habit, and any truth seeking practice runs the risk of turning into a mindless habit as well.

This is the greatest challenge with using time as a means to measure the productivity of a truth seeking practice. You’ll get a dopamine hit by checking off a box in your todo list for, say, practicing for 40 minutes, while it could have been a mindless exercise.

It’s tragically hilarious that a mind-”ful” practice can quickly devolve into a mind-”less” exercise if you’re not careful.

Be cautious about applying standard productivity measurement techniques to truth seeking.

## Apply internal truth seeking to the external world

Truth seeking works well with other techniques to help you improve decision making, managing stress.

As you become better at seeking internal truths, and you build the muscle of observing what’s happening inside, you’ll become better at activating that muscle in realtime.

Above, I’ve presented training your mind as some practice that you carve out time for to do, and once you’re done, you’re done.

But, like how going to the gym to train your body enables you to apply that body in stronger ways in the real world, training your mind in your mental “gym” session allows you to apply that objective observation of reality muscle in realtime when you need it.

The way it manifests is that you’ll be much quicker at catching thoughts and feelings that arise in a particular situation.

For example, when you’re analyzing 

- Talk about how seeking truth forces you to take more ownership (using the conscious contradiction minimization that happens. When you see that you’re the cause, you can’t help but take ownership because otherwise it creates a contradiction).

You’ll find that you make better decisions, see greater possibilities, are more calm, more accepting of a rapidly changing world and environment.

## Build a truth seeking team

Teams that win consistently over long periods [x] of time require a strong foundation of truth seeking.

And the nature of growth itself makes truth seeking more difficult as collective delusion scales exponentially with number of people in a team.

Communication is a lossy transmission of information. Even if you see the truth clearly, when you share it with someone else, there is information lost, as well as information warped (by their own delusions that warp their perception of reality).

1. You must only hire truth seekers.
    1. Fortunately a truth seeker tends to only get better over time as they realize the immense value it offers.
    2. How to evaluate truth seeking skill. 
        1. Observe how someone has changed their mind about something (but this can’t be in a dogmatic way - which is why their reasoning).
        2. The interview process cannot be standardized in any way.
        3. Creating value in any sense requires resonance with the truth. Doing it consistently over time requires truth seeking.
2. Each member of the team must have constant exposure to end-users to take advantage of subconscious pain-minimization optimization. Otherwise their truth seeking skills go to waste since they’re not able to replicate external truths (that someone else has), internally. Mirror-neurons → What happens when you talk to a user in pain.
3. Excellent communication. Realtime and async are important.
4. Set up incentives that are aligned with truth seeking:
    1. Right now, the way organizations are set up, there is great pressure against experimentation and cutting features 

- Incentives that align conscious and subconscious → This is huge. Think this through in detail.

Communication is a lossy transmission of information. Even if you see the truth clearly, when you share it with someone else, there is information lost, as well as information warped (by their own delusions that warp their perception of reality).

Which is why at the least starting from a position of greater truth in your own mind allows you to communicate information that is more true so that you can collectively make better decisions.

When you see how deluded your mind is, and the value of truth seeking, you can’t help but only work with people who are great at seeking truth. Otherwise your company will drive itself off the cliff. [x].

## Value of truth seeking is rising exponentially.

Rapid increase in technological leverage, and anxiety.

Seeking truth enables you take advantage of this leverage as a force multiplier for all the things that are required to thrive in this future.

- Rapid rate of change ⇒ more anxiety, and fears about our value in the world (all stemming from the subconscious).
- 

The only thing stopping you is yourself.

As AI and technological leverage increase, the following also increase at same rate:

1. Power of each decision you make.
2. Power of each idea.

At the same time, there are more distractions now than ever before as a result of the same technologies.

Whether you take advantage of this rapid change or succumb to it depends on your ability to seek truth.

*This essay is directed towards a younger, more deluded, version of myself that kept failing to do good work, without realizing that his problem - and solution - was in his own mind.*

## Notes

[x] This is why I’m not a fan team cultures that emphasize “low egos”. I often find these teams full of people that simply don’t care. It’s easy to agree with someone, or let your ideas be discarded when you don’t give a shit about the product. No, I want to work with people that have massive egos WITH the self-awareness to see the truth about themselves and in their work. They do great work by making their egos work for the product. I believe truth seeking is the most important cultural value.

- Stop hating on your ego. When it operates with greater visibility into the truth, it’s a powerful positive force for your growth. High ego + truth seeking > low ego + delusion. Don’t worry about reducing ego. Enough truth seeking will do what needs to be done to it :).

[x] (Something about how people say “Be more ambitious”, but they don’t really tell you how. It’s kind of silly).

[x] I don’t think committee based decision making works well, except in certain extreme scenarios. So here I’m talking about feedback without necessarily increasing the number of decision makers.

[x] Collective delusion is the primary cause for companies driving themselves off the cliff. And it looks ridiculous from the outside, like how could IBM not see the importance of home computers, or Japanese hardware companies see the shift in power to software, or Google see the importance of shipping actual AI products before some tiny, significantly less funded startup. But, it’s easy to point fingers at these companies until you run one off the cliff just like them. Curb that delusion my friend, or the world will humble you real fast.

[x] When a contradiction between the conscious and subconscious mind itself is stressful, just imagine how stressful contradiction in the conscious mind itself can be! High integrity people tend to be less stressed than low integrity people because they don’t add an additional stress on top of all the existing ones. It’s also cool that “integrity” translates to both being honest and is also the quality of being whole or complete. When the conscious understands the subconscious, the mind becomes more whole and you’ll naturally be more honest.

### To add (maybe)

- All great creations is constructed around a truth. That truth is often a truth about how our mind works, how the world works, or some combination. - Dive deep into this. It's a great point. It could actually be the foundation for the essay.
- I think it would be helpful to talk about all of my failures to ground my learnings in my life. I’m not sure, will think about it later.
- More thought on the connection between how seeking internal truth makes you that much better at observing external truth. There is a better explanation here with examples.
    - E.g. give the example of how you can read a research paper with less bias. Or you interpret product feedback in a way that most aligns with reality with a better ability to put aside what you want it to be, and focus on what it actually is.
    - Truths are all around you to be observed, but our own mind prevents us from seeing it.
    - Put two founders in the same exact environment, same product, same everything, the one that is a better truth seeker will draw the right insights from their observations of reality and will greatly outperform the other.
    - The greater the leverage that exists, the degree of outperformance increases.
    - As you keep practicing, what starts off as an after the fact processing, turns into a realtime one. As you get feedback
- Disagreeing with PGs recommendations for how to get around schlep blindness:
    - And in some cases, truth seeking is a better way to approach improving a skill.
        
        For example, in the context of overcoming our conscious blind spots in the case of coming up with startup ideas, in his essay [Schlep Blindness](https://paulgraham.com/schlep.html), Paul Graham says:
        
        > How do you overcome schlep blindness? Frankly, the most valuable antidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance. Most successful founders would probably say that if they'd known when they were starting their company about the obstacles they'd have to overcome, they might never have started it. Maybe that's one reason the most successful startups of all so often have young founders.
        
        In practice the founders grow with the problems. But no one seems able to foresee that, not even older, more experienced founders. So the reason younger founders have an advantage is that they make two mistakes that cancel each other out. They don't know how much they can grow, but they also don't know how much they'll need to. Older founders only make the first mistake.
        
        Ignorance can't solve everything though. Some ideas so obviously entail alarming schleps that anyone can see them. How do you see ideas like that? The trick I recommend is to take yourself out of the picture. Instead of asking "what problem should I solve?" ask "what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?" If someone who had to process payments before Stripe had tried asking that, Stripe would have been one of the first things they wished for.
        > 
        
        But I believe seeking truth is a more powerful antidote to schlep blindness (i.e. not being able to see certain paths - startup ideas in this case) than either relying on ignorance, or asking “what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?”.

- Something about how easy it is to delude yourself into thinking that
- I definitely see myself increasing the duration of truth seeking practice as I have more leverage since the weight of idea increases far more than the weight of executing that idea (bec. AI will do it for me). - This is powerful. This just makes so much sense.

In fact all of your essays are downstream consequences of this.
Truth seeking teams NEED to be small because collective delusion grows exponentially with number of people. Truth seekers are invaluable, therefore you will only have companies of cofounders because only cofounder level equity makes sense for them. This is the truth about the world that at this moment I see unfolding in front of us, and probably faster than we expect.

By building a truth seeking team the right way, you will outcompete any team that has a greater collective delusion than your team. It will only be a matter of time.

Dear founder, I admire you for setting out to bring something of value into this world. (a nice heartfelt conclusion would be nice. I would appreciate it as a reader.)
