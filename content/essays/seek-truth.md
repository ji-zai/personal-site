title: Seeking truth is the only skill

I started writing this essay to get a sense for what the most valuable skills will be in a future in which AI becomes incredibly powerful. As I spent more time exploring this question I realized that any valuable skill, at its core, is either a process of seeking the truth about the world we live in, or about ourselves. 

And I believe even that distinction (internal vs. external) is only intellectual. Our ability to seek truth about the world we live in is directly, greatly, impacted by our ability to seek truth about ourselves. After all, your mind is your lens into the world; you can't trust it without understanding it.
## I) Seeking truth
### What does "seeking truth" even mean?
By "truth" I mean some property or rule we can observe about a system that exists in reality.

By "system", I mean anything that has some phenomena, or things happening in it. It doesn't matter whether you can observe those things or not. Before we had the microscope we couldn't observe the microscopic properties of biological systems, but those properties of course existed.

By "seeking truth", I mean the quest to understand the properties / rules of any system. 

I love the word "seek" because I think it perfectly encapsulates a truth about seeking truth: it is a process of iteration that can only better approximate the reality of a system, without ever reaching it. If you ever reach complete understanding of a system, you've "found" truth, which is clearly far from being the case for most, if not all, systems we've encountered in nature.
### What's the point of seeking truth? 
Well, if you have no wants, are perfectly content what what you have and what you understand about the world and yourself, there would be no point to seeking truth.

Two characteristics of our minds gives purpose to seeking truth: we want, and we want to get what we want as quick as possible.

The things we want are part of systems, and so, the more quickly we can seek truths about the systems that govern our wants, the more quickly we can get what we want. (note: even curiosity: a want to simply understand a system is still a want).

But, more often than not, the purpose of seeking truth is to gain power over a system, so that you can get what we want from it, as quickly as you can. 

Time is the only thing that is technically scarce for us. All other resources are only scarce to the extent that we don't yet know the truths about the various systems that govern those resources to enable us to extract them efficiently. We've observed an abundance of water, energy, and any resource other than time.

Because time is our only scarcity, when you decide to become better at seeking truth, all it means is that you want to seek truth faster than you can right now, so that you can get what you want more quickly.
### Clearly seeking truth is valuable. But is it a skill?
### What is the role of luck?
### Not all truths are created equal.
### Skill in seeking truth compounds.
### It's a generalizable skill.
### Is there an upper limit to how good you can be at seeking truth?
### What stops us from seeking truth optimally?
### Self-delusion is the greatest obstacle to being great at seeking truth.

## II) Self-delusion is the greatest delusion
### We don't know what's happening in our minds.
### What is "feeling"?
### Thinking is grounded in feeling.
### Sensitivity is how much you're aware of what you're feeling.
This implies that there's some feelings that are happening that you can't feel right now.
### Feelings are where our biases are held.
### Subconscious biases hold us back from seeking truth.
### Collective delusion compounds exponentially.
### Bias isn't the same as intuition.

## III) Seeking truth is the only skill
### Seeking truth doesn't generalize fully, but only to the medium of observation.
I was wrong above when I said that skill in seeking truth generalizes to any system. It only generalizes to the medium of observation.

### Seeking truth well requires seeking truth in both mediums: thinking and feeling.
### Exponential rise in technology will make seeking truth the only skill that remains.
### All valuable skills are derived from seeking truth.
### "Truth seeker" is the most robust identity.
### AI will show us what makes us human.
### How do we create a truth seeking world?
