title: Seeking truth is the only skill

### There is only one skill

I believe there is only one skill that lies at the root of all skills: seeking truth.

Our ability to get what we want depends on how good we are this skill. Improving this skill positively impacts our ability to get what we want. And it doesn’t matter what it is that we want.

Unfortunately, we’re terrible at it.

Partly because of limitations of ourselves (the human condition) and inability of our minds to understand the incredibly complex world and universe that we operate in.

But, mostly because we haven’t sufficiently studied what this skill is and how to improve it. I believe we are very far from being as good as we can be individually, and by extension, as a species we are incredibly far from being as good as we can be to get what we collectively want: i.e. solving all of humanity’s problems.

I started writing this essay to understand how to become better at my craft: building products and companies. But the more I made sense of what held me back, the more I realized the same things held me back from every single thing that I aimed to be great at. Whether that was becoming a better friend, son, partner, or becoming better at having ideas, or becoming better at communicating, or understanding myself, or even becoming better at being at peace.

The underlying principles are the exact same, because fundamentally, they all require us to use a common set of tools: a mind and body. Our mind fundamentally doesn’t change how it approaches getting what it wants, no matter what that want is. Whether it is to build a great product, to create a meaningful song, to dance well, to connect with others, or anything. All visible differences are surface level.

I was selfishly excited by this realization because it meant that if I studied in depth the essence of what held me back in one domain, I could improve my ability to get anything I want.

After studying how the world is changing, I also believe that it’s more important now than ever before to become great at this skill because the penalty for being bad at it is rising. That sounds like a paradox: with greater technology shouldn’t it be easier for us to get what we want, and therefore shouldn’t the bar for this skill be lowered? That’s not what happens because our wants evolve in response to technology. When it gets easy to get what we want, we move the goalpost for what we want. Our expectations rise.

That’s both the blessing and the curse of the human condition. It means that we are always aiming higher, growing, and improving ourselves. There’s always room to want more.

And because our wants are more difficult to fulfill, it is incredibly important to improve our ability to seek truth, so that we improve our skill to match the higher difficulty of our wants.

But, even if you don’t buy that it will become more difficult to get what we want, if you want to improve your ability to get what you want today, it would still make sense to study how.

I’ve divided this essay into 3 sections. In the first I walk through what I mean when I say “seek truth”. I then explore what mastery looks through examples to help us see what makes someone great and how they are different from the rest of us. Lastly, I’ll discuss how I see the world changing and how the nature of this skill is changing in response to the changing world.

Understanding how the world is changing and how that impacts this skill is critical because it directly impacts the way we train ourselves. If we train a muscle that it turns out won't be required soon, then it's wasted effort. It could also be dangerous if we train ourselves in ways that will make us worse at seeking truth in the long-run. We will only know that if we understand how this skill itself will change over time.

### Seeking truth

In its essence, seeking truth is to understand how things work in order to get what we want.

That sounds incredibly obvious. Why can’t we just call it “understanding things” and just get on with it? Because while it’s true, it’s incredibly inaccurate. And an inaccurate understanding means it’s difficult to act on it. After all, all of us are trying to understand things to get what we want, and yet there’s a lot of room for improvement.

I like “seek truth” as the name for this skill because it hints at certain non-intuitive qualities about the process.

“Seek” means always striving, but never getting. For anyone that has tried to understand anything, it will be clear that we can only improve our understanding but never fully know. There is always greater understanding to be had.

“Seek” also implies that it is a search problem. And I believe that representing this process as a recursive search problem is the right way to think about it.

“Truth” implies that there is at least some sense of order to the world. For example, the equation that represents gravity is a truth that represents how two bodies of masses interact with each other. Similarly, there is a sense of order to every aspect of world: business, arts, policy etc.

Truth also implies that there is reality. And the fact that we are seeking truth means that we don’t fully understand reality.

Another important point is that seeking truth only matters if you want things. If you don’t want anything, there is no need to seek truth. Each want has its own truth seeking process, and of course it’s possible to be good at fulfilling one want but not another.

---

### Truth & delusion

We’ll need to define a few fundamental concepts in order for us to build up a model of what seeking truth means.

Let’s define “truth” as a statement (for now let’s consider this statement to be in English / mathematical notation).

(note: Of course a statement written in English that describes something can never fully represent it, but let’s ignore this for now since that leads to an unnecessarily philosophical tangent. By treating it as a statement, we can still build a reasonably accurate model of seeking truth.)

Each of us has a set of truths that we believe to be true. These truths that we live by impact the way we live our lives, what we do, and how we go about getting the things we want.

Naturally, the truths we believe in are not always aligned with reality to varying degrees.

Let’s define “delusion” as the degree to which a belief is mis-aligned with reality. We are deluded to the degree what we believe in is mis-aligned with reality.

When we seek truth and understand more about the world, we form beliefs about what is true. This may include clearing out beliefs we had that we realized weren’t actually true, and forming new beliefs that we didn’t have before about what is true.

The challenge with delusion is that we can only see it in hindsight. When we are deluded about something, we don’t know what we’re deluded about, because if we knew exactly what it was, it would no longer be a delusion.

We’re also deluded about the things we don’t know, not just our inaccurate beliefs. E.g. someone who wants to get something but has no idea how to is quite deluded, as is someone who has very strong beliefs about how to get what they want but all of their beliefs are glaringly incorrect. Are there situations in which one kind of delusion is better than the other? I think so, and we’ll explore this as we dive deeper.

---

### A truth has a notion of value

The value of a truth corresponds with how helpful it is in enabling you to get what you want. The notion of “value” only exists when coupled with a want. Nature has no notion of value, everything is just true. Only a being that wants, values.

For example, if you want to build a bridge understanding the truths about gravity, forces, materials, resistance, etc. are incredibly valuable, while truths about how to make music wouldn’t be.

Of course our wants can change. Value of a truth changes over time, depending on how wants change. Something you valued highly when you wanted something, you may not value at all once that want passes - until the want returns.

---

### Values of truths follow a power law

For a given want, some truths are orders of magnitude more valuable than others.

This is just an observation of nature. I don’t know why this is the case, but it seems to be true if we look back at how we've uncovered truths about the world.

For example, for someone that wants to build a bridge, the truth about the equation of gravity is orders of magnitude more valuable than the truth "when you throw a ball up it falls down".

Both are true, yet one is far more valuable because of its predictive power: it explains far more about the world, and therefore you can leverage that truth to get more of what you want, more quickly, for longer periods of time (i.e. robust to change).

At times you’ll need to uncover multiple truths in order to “unlock” a significantly higher valued truth. This feature of truths seeking is the hallmark of human progress. We collectively uncover a set of truths, and then someone connects the dots and finds a much more valuable underlying truth that explains them all, and also explains phenomena that we might not have even understood yet.

These are breakthroughs, and we find them in every field. Companies too are founded on a set of truths that the founders believe about the world. And if the truths they build the company on are incredibly valuable, they are far more likely to succeed and build a generational company.

Art is also grounded in some truths the artist feels about the human condition. Every now and then we find an artist that expresses these truths in such a profound way that we can't help but be moved by them. They create a new trend.

Seeking truth is all about uncovering such higher valued truths so that we can be much better at getting what we want.

---

### Wants have expectations

When you want something and you don't know how to fulfill it it means the highest value truth you believe in (for this want) isn't high enough value to enable you to fulfill it.

---

### Ability to act

If you can’t act on beliefs, you can’t get what you want.

Acting is doing things that aren't directly related to updating your beliefs. For example, if you want to eat food and you believe that there are leftovers in your refrigerator, acting would be you grabbing that food and eating it.

Similarly, if you want to edit a video, don't know how to (i.e. the highest value truth you believe in isn't sufficient to fulfill this want), and believe that searching online will lead you to learning how, then acting on that belief would be typing the search term in your phone and pressing submit.

By not being able to act, not only would you not get what you want, you won't be able to improve your beliefs. Acting is what shows you whether what you believed will fulfill your want actually does. And when it doesn't, you're forced to improve your understanding.

---

### A want leads to more wants

When you want something and you know how to get it, there's of course no need to seek truth, you'll simply act on your beliefs and get what you want.

Seeking truth only happens when you are unable to fulfill your want in this moment. This pushes you to uncover more valuable truths than the ones you already believe in, to fulfill your want.

In this process, you may uncover a truth that you believe is valuable enough to fulfill your want, but you still cannot act on that truth to get what you want. When this happens, your mind generates a new want: the want to be able to act on the truth. Let's call this new want a "child" of the initial "parent" want.

For example, let's say you have a want to solve a problem you have by building an app. By seeking truth you uncover the truth: "The solution can be coded using acme programming framework.". You believe this truth, but you don't know how to program in that way.

When this happens, a child want is formed: the want to learn how to code in the acme framework in order to build the app, in order to fulfill your want to solve your problem.

Similarly, the child want will generate more child wants.

---

### Seeking truth is a recursive search for higher value truths

Recursion is a method of solving a problem where a solution depends on the solution of smaller instances of the same problem. And therefore fulfilling a want is a recursive process.

To solve for one want, we often must solve for other wants, and therefore the process of getting what we want (seeking truth) is a recursive process.

This process looks like a tree.

(todo: a stellar animation to show how this works)

---

### Time is scarce

Most of our wants are difficult to fulfill. What this means is that there are many, many sub-trees. So many that it feels infinite (and maybe it is?).

Yet, we want to get what we want as quickly as possible.

This is what creates the necessary tension in our system to push us to be more effective at seeking truth.

If we didn't want to get what we wanted as quickly as possible, then we'd just keep going down a single branch of the tree without ever coming back up, and just die.

Of course that doesn't happen becuase we become frustrated the longer we go without getting what we want. This is useful. Without this frustration (or discomfort / agitation - whatever you want to call it), time would not be scarce for us, and there would be no need to be effective at seeking truth, and, well, we wouldn't be where we are as a species.

---

### Satiation & the lack of it

We cut off paths of exploration based on satiation or lack of it. Satiation means that we fulfill our want. Lack of it means we haven't. So clearly there's an aspect of time here.

Lack of satiation is proportional to the time you've spent seeking truth without satiating your want.

---

### Every skill can be modeled as seeking truth

- A founder building a company
- A scientist understanding something
- An artist making a video

---

### How we blunder

- Show every single way we get lost in the search.
- We get stuck to paths even when there is strong evidence that is presented to us that it isn’t the best path.
- We often predict what we want to be true, but is far from the truth, leading us down wrong paths (wrong in the sense of being able to get what you want).
- But this isn’t enough detail to understand how to improve, or to even understand what’s going on. If my mind isn’t generating the predictions, and if it isn’t able to accurately value predictions so that it chooses the best ones, then what can I do to improve? What impacts that ability?

---

### Why do we blunder?

- We need a theory of mind to explain this.
- And anyone that talks about any skill either explicitly or implicitly has a theory of mind.

---

### Four seeking functions of the mind

---

### A. Observe

---

### B. Understand

---

### C. Value

---

### D. Predict

---

### Conditioning

- Conditioning is a reaction to a want. It gets triggered (meaning you feel the pull) as soon as the want arises.

---

### The mind conditions itself in response to satiation.

---

### The mind is fundamentally addictive

- This is why intellectually understanding what to do will not enable us to act on it if our conditioning is too difficult to override.

---

### A belief is also conditioned

- This is

---

### Conditioning can be blinding

- (this also means that we are blind to the conditoining itself).
- Map back to the tree search
- If the conditioning is too deeply rooted, it will blind you.
- Schlep blindness.
- Scientific approach blindness.
- Artist blindness.

---

### Willpower

- The ability to act against conditioning
- Map back to the tree search.

---

### Memory

- Define: recall beliefs in the form of thoughts, and to recall the search tree - to remember where you are, and how you got here in the tree.
- Our memory is not as good as we think it is (even in day to day conversations we tend to forget how we got there, or we go deep into unnecessary tangents forgetting the purpose of our conversation in the first place (when there is a purpose ofc). This is the memory function of the mind.
- Map back to the tree search.

---

### Ability to act and ability to seek truth are different.

- Yet, they are tightly coupled. Without one the other isn't useful. Imagine having the ability to act but inability to seek truth, meaning you'll build products that no one wants. Or publish a book that you yourself don't like.
- Why is it necessary to make this distinction? - because they are fundamentally different processes.
- Ability to act also includes: reasoning, and engaging with the outside world.
- Can use Chess as an example here.

(This may go in the change section when I talk about how the importance of each is changing).

---

### Difficult wants

Some wants are difficult to fulfill. Some are easy.

In the modern world, the want for food is significantly easier to fulfill for most people than the want to build a valuable company / shape public policy / win an election / make meaningful art, etc.

The possible paths grows larger for more difficult wants, and it’s more difficult to assess the right path to take.

For example, in the modern world if you want food and have some money in your hands, you have a small set of options in front of you: groceries and cook, restaurant, free food at an event, etc. There’s only so much you can explore here before you exhaust all options. Making a movie on the other hand has too many paths that are difficult to assess which is better.

- Maybe there’s some mathematical angle here that is useful. (tree breadth vs. depth. The more possibilities, the larger the tree, and the larger the tree, the more opportunities for delusion.)

---

### There is objectivity in how to measure ability to seek truth.

For a given want, there is an objectively better and worse way to value a truth.

Subjectivity also exists. When two people value truths differently, it doesn’t mean one is better and the other is worse because there is subjectivity to the degree that wants differ. In the extreme case: two people with very different wants will value the same truth quite differently, while both could potentially be valuing it well.

So we can objectively compare how well two individuals value a truth to the degree they want the same thing. This objectivity is incredibly useful because it helps us study a skill by comparing individuals, or by comparing ourselves with our past selves and seeing the difference in how we valued a truth and why we did.

Culturally I feel that we've moved away from looking at the world in terms of right and wrong, better and worse, etc. But this is a glaring mistake. There is almost certainly a better way of approaching things - for a given want. Yet, between us, what is better or worse only differs to the degree that our wants differ.

---

### Small difference in ability = massive difference in results

→ Keep this minimal, there is no need to get into crazy theory, or get too technical. That’s not the point of this.

→ Actually I do need to get into the power law - but perhaps the more detailed example can come later.

---

### What impacts your ability to seek truth well?

(_And define that this ability in terms of navigating the tree_).

For now, let’s ignore factors about the world such as the level of technology available, whether you have the liberty to act freely, etc. Let’s fix all of those factors by saying you’re a person living in a place with access to the internet, the freedom to consume information freely, and can share your thinking with the world.

### Internal factors

Now, there are two ways to think about ability: what factors determine your ability right now, in this moment, and how your ability changes over time, and how much of that change you can control.

A good analogy is to think about professional runners who are running the 100m race at the olympics. Their ability to perform in the race depends on a set of factors such as the power in their muscles, fuel in their bodies, how anxious they are, etc. And how their ability changes over time, and how much of that they can control tells us about the best training programs and lifestyle that will enable them to mold their minds and bodies in a way that maximizes their ability to perform well in future races.

Similarly for us, understanding the factors that determine ability to get what we want help us understand the areas where we ought to focus on in order to train this skill. Understanding how this ability changes over time and how much of that change we can control helps us see how to act and train ourselves to become better at this skill, to the extent that it is a skill (i.e. that we have control over).

There are four factors of yourself that determine ability to get what you want because they directly impact your ability to navigate the truth seeking search tree.

1. Conditioning
2. Memory
3. Ability to act
4. Willpower.

Your current conditioning of the mind for your current want determines how your mind observes, understands, values, and predicts based on the information your senses perceive. And, as we discussed earlier, your conditioning can be felt as a “pull” towards a certain way of doing things.

Memory is the ability to recall a belief as a thought. For example, when you feel a want for food, memory is your ability to recall that you have leftovers in the refrigerator.

Your ability to operate against your conditioning is your ability to resist the pull you feel towards a particular way of doing things. If you have a want for food, and your mind is conditioned to only observe, understand, value and predict in a way that leads you to junk food, this ability is your ability to wait the pull out without caving in. For a lack of a better word at the moment, let’s call this “willpower”. But I think it’s a poor word to describe the actual ability, which I’ll cover in a future essay.

Your ability to act in the world is your literal ability, physical, mental, etc. to do the things that you believe you need to do in order to get what you want. Acting is what separates those that have valuable beliefs and those with valuable beliefs who actually get what they want with those beliefs.

To understand how each factor impacts our ability to get what we want, let’s take two individuals Alice, and Bob, with the exact same difficult want, meaning the want will require significant truth seeking to fulfill because there are a vast number of paths one could take to fulfill it.

---

### Difference in conditioning

Let’s say they are equivalent in all factors except for current conditioning. Even though they have the same exact beliefs in this moment, same ability to act, same willpower, their paths will diverge because they observe, understand, value, and predict differently. The longer they seek truth to get what they want, the further their paths will diverge, leading one to drastically outperform the other to get what they want, if their conditioning nudges them in the right way,

You may wonder about the scenario in which both of their willpowers are sufficient to override each of their conditionings, which would result in them taking the same exact path since all other factors are equal. In practice this is incredibly unlikely, because, as we’ll see later, it would mean that we have the power to override all of our biases at will, and so few, if any, of us can accomplish this that I’d consider this impossible for now.

As we saw earlier, a belief is also represented as conditioning in the mind, so difference in conditioning also implies a difference in beliefs. Two people with the same exact conditionings believe the same exact things, only to different degrees based on the strength of their conditionings.

---

### Difference in memory

---

### Difference in willpower

Given all factors equal, a difference in willpower would lead to a difference in the path taken during seeking truth because it means that one will have more control over what they do. Willpower allows resisting the conditioning, so one with greater willpower would be able to, for example, spend more time seeking truth at a particular layer int he tree, without going down deeper (i.e. chasing the sub-want).

But willpower falls short in that you need to be able to "see" the conditioning if you want to be able to "override" it. But what happens when you don't even realize that your conditioning is pushing you in a certain direction? How can you override that?

---

### Difference in ability to act

Two individuals differing in their ability to act on their beliefs, with all other factors kept equal (conditioning, memory, willpower), will take different paths.

Inability to act takes different forms. It can slow you down, completely block you from a path you want to take, or even condition your mind to not even see certain paths.

For example, when one individual has a slower mental processing power, they will lag behind the one that can think things through faster, calculate faster and decide faster. With all else being equal, these two individuals will take similar paths, but one faster than the other.

But if mental processing is too slow, the world could change significantly, rendering their plans obsolete or less impactful by the time they get around to doing it. So the faster the world changes, the less “room” exists to be slow because its penalty is greater.

Sometimes a path can be completely blocked off, either due to personal incompetence or due of external circumstances. There may be two brilliant startup founders with the same exact idea and competence, yet one has to take up a job to support their family while the other has the ability to pursue their idea. This individual that joins a job will likely take a very different path to get what they want, or may even change what they want in due time.

Interestingly, the mind, in order to protect itself from lack of satiation, will condition itself to not even consider, value, and sometimes even see, paths that it believes you cannot act on in order to get what you want.

---

### These factors are not equal, nor independent

One factor can impact the other. They aren’t completely independent as I’ve made them seem.

Someone with a strong willpower, but an even stronger conditioning (that pulls them away from getting what they want) is worse off than someone with weak willpower, but conditioning that actually helps them get what they want - because they don’t have to override it much.

Someone who is slightly slower to act than another, but has a slightly better conditioning than the other, (and all else kept equal), will do better because in their case the inability to act only slows them down (relative to the other), rather than completely change their path. In that case, I’d bet on the better conditioning.

Someone with great conditioning but amnesia will likely perform better than someone without amnesia but terrible conditioning. For example, if Steve Jobs were alive with amnesia, I would still run product ideas and designs by him to get his “feel” for it. Though he may not be able to explain why, his intuition is still likely to be right, and I’d bet this feedback would be orders of magnitude more helpful than from someone who has only read theory on how to build great products, and remembers the theory well, but doesn’t have the conditioning required to form an intuition about them.

So prioritizing clearly depends on the individual. But for an individual, I believe these factors are not equally contributing to an their ability to get what they want - in that moment in time, and that there would be a top factor that is the main bottleneck for them.

In order to better understand how these factors impact individuals and how these factors change over time, it’ll help to look at some examples of people becoming better at what they do and study how they did so.

---

### Four stages of mastery

Each stage corresponds to a change in ability (i.e. conditioning, memory, ability to act, willpower).

1. _Novice_ = has no useful conditioning, no useful beliefs to recall (memory), minimal ability to act since they don’t know the tools, methodologies, techniques, frameworks of the craft. They may have willpower, which may have been trained separately from this process of getting what you want.
2. _Average_ = has some conditioning that makes them somewhat useful to their teams, and companies, has some useful beliefs to recall, has some ability to act: by mimicking others, intellectually learning certain techniques, frameworks, etc.
3. _Great_ = intuition. But even greats eventually become outdated.
4. _Master_ = a great that can become & remain great in a rapidly changing world.

---

### A novice that wants to build a company

To understand these stages, let’s take the example of a novice entrepreneur that wants to solve a problem in the world by creating a product, and by extension building a company.

When they first have this want, they likely don’t know much about how to fulfill it. They may not know much about the problem they want to solve, or how to go about tackling it.

This is the first, novice stage: they haven’t built up any conditioning to fulfill this want (i.e. they have a weak ability to observe, understand, value, and predict in a way that enables them to seek truth well), they don’t have any valuable beliefs to recall (memory), they haven’t learned the techniques, frameworks, intellectual knowledge for how to approach it (ability to act). They may have some willpower trained on other activities, or perhaps even something they cultivated innately.

---

### A novice mimics

A novice will eventually seek truth for how to fulfill this want. But, because they don’t have any conditioning yet to fulfill this want, they’ll do some research, look at others that who the novice considers “successful” and will start mimicking them.

That may sound dismissive, but how else would a novice know what to do to fulfill a difficult want? If they don’t have any conditioning, it means that their functions of observing, understanding, valuing and predicting are quite deluded - mis-aligned with reality, and they’re confused.

The novice’s mind will start to observe those that it thinks are “successful”, in order to copy them. And it often chooses who to mimic based on some notion of status. Why status? Well, what other way is there? A novice doesn’t have sufficient understanding to analyze the foundations of what makes a great company, or the nature of the problem they’re trying to solve before they decide what to do.

Our novice will likely look at those successful at building companies and will believe the path they took to do so. They’ll find them on social media, award lists, and will generally gravitate towards those with larger followings.

I definitely followed this approach when I was starting out, and I suspect everyone has to some extent. It’s tough to find another way.

---

### The average

Our novice has binged a bunch of videos, followed some superstar entrepreneurs on social platforms, and eventually they decide that the best step for them to take to be able to build a company is to join a company that is solving the problem they care about.

Most likely they choose this path because the superstar entrepreneurs they follow online seem to have taken the path of joining an incredible startup before starting their own, and perhaps because their friends that they respect also seem to be taking this path.

So the novice works hard to land a job at a company that matches their criteria. Through a similar truth seeking journey they may decide that the best way to get in is to have a college degree, so they spend a few years getting one, applying and eventually getting into a good company.

After working incredibly hard at the company for a few years, our novice has graduated to become average.

The average is conditioned in a way that allows them to observe, understand, value, and predict truths that allow them to continue to be useful to their team, and thereby company. This means they likely build intuition for what their teammates and managers expect of them, as well as intuition for what to do, say, and how to act within the company in order to meet the goals set for them.

In addition to conditioning, the average has more tools and frameworks they can apply that improves their ability to act.

While the novice may not even know intellectually how a company operates, or how products are built, the average does. Unlike the novice, the average has the ability to create value for their company. Depending on their role, they may know how to get and process feedback from customers, analyze it to make decisions, present findings to the company, how to build software, etc. They’re effective.

Most of us who work hard will eventually reach the stage of being average at what we do (as defined above).

---

### Note: The average are better than their name sounds.

By this definition of average, there are likely millionaires, billionaires even, and could have done work that was truly meaningful and beneficial to humanity that would be considered “average” according to this framework.

And so, I want to be clear, I’m not using the label “average” to be condescending, I simply couldn’t find a more appropriate word. I couldn’t use “good” because that makes it sound too close to “great”, which it’s not. There’s a monumental difference between average and great. So much so, that today, the average is just a slight step up from novice. Eventually the average will, surprisingly, be worse than the novice. We’ll see why later when we analyze how the world is changing and what that means for the ability to get what you want.

<aside>
💡 You’re probably average. I know I’m average - which is actually why I’m writing this damn essay in the first place! I felt thinking this through was necessary to become better at getting what I want, which I later realized meant becoming better at seeking truth.
</aside>

---

### Great : average = intuition : bias.

The difference between the great and the average is the difference between intuition and bias.

Unfortunately our common definitions for intuition and bias suck at accurately explaining what they are and how they relate to each other. According to the dictionary: “Bias” = “_the action of supporting or opposing a particular person or thing in an unfair way”._ “Intuition” = “the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.”

_What these definitions hide is that intuition and bias are the same exact thing!_ They’re both just conditioning. The mind has no internal distinction between intuition and bias.

We refer to a conditioning as intuition when it helps us get what we want (which usually happens when the conditioning is aligned with reality), and bias when it doesn’t help us get what we want (when conditioning is mis-aligned with reality). Therefore the degree of delusion in our conditioning determines whether a conditioning is an intuition or bias.

_Where to talk about how a belief itself is conditioning → you can’t simply decide you’re going to stop believing._

- And need to explain the difference between memory and conditioning. (Amnesia. A racist that loses ability to recall beliefs will still have a negative feeling when they see someone from a race they dislike).

---

### Whether conditioning is bias or intuition depends on the want

- What you consider to be bias, another may use it as intuition if it helps them get what they want.
- E.g. those that believe in God.
- E.g. Ramanujan.

---

### The average are far more biased than greats

The average’s mind is conditioned towards being relevant for their company, not towards being able to solve a problem meaningfully for the world, even though that’s what they want (or thought they wanted).

What causes satiation in the mind is what the mind conditions itself towards.

The average is satiated by positive feedback from their teammates and who they report to. But why is that a problem? Well, it isn’t a problem if who they work with are incredibly well aligned with the reality of the world such that making the team happy is equivalent to solving this problem for the world. But that’s obviously far from the case.

In the case of a team of people trying to solve a problem in the world,

For the average, satiation doesn’t fulfill their want (to solve a problem).

And the cause for satiation for the average is often another person - or a small group of people. This means that

- Proxy for the market is significantly mis-aligned from reality because of how deluded all of us are. The more people you go through before you directly interact with the truth, the more deluded you are - on top of all the ways you’re deluded individually.
- This is precisely why large companies fail.

---

### Proxies between you and reality compound delusion exponentially

And you are one of them! We ourselves can’t see reality as it is due to the limitations of our selves - only a minor portion of what senses captures enter our conscious mind through our conditioning. As we saw earlier, we ourselves are so terribly deluded.

Now, adding another person between you and reality means that your starting point is with all of their delusions!

And purely based on the numbers, most people with the want to solve a problem for the world work at large companies since those companies hire the most people. Therefore most people that want to positively impact the world have many layers of proxies between them and reality, conditioning them in ways that optimizes their conditioning for the delusions of their specific companies and teams, rather than towards solving the problem they want to solve for the world.

And each company is incredibly deluded about the world - just in slightly different ways. (ofc need to substantiate this). - ie: “each proxy is incredibly deluded”. - and even those we consider GREATS are also incredibly deluded. - it is a limitation of the human condition.

- Your senses are also just a proxy for reality! We already know of phenomena we can measure in the universe that we can’t perceive through our senses. → This is an important point. Which is why even if you want to make something people want, you often only work with proxies: each individual customer

### Can you control your satiation?

Is it possible to not let praise from your team and manager get to you and only allow yourself to be satiated by how well the market appreciates your impact?

This is assuming too much power in our hands. The old adage “you are the average of the people you spend time with” is true because evolution has made us care deeply about pleasing those around us.

Even those that you wouldn’t consider “people pleasers” are still deeply people pleasers, perhaps just a bit less than you and me. This conditioning is deeply ingrained, and for good reason! It helps us survive by enabling us to cooperate, and appease each other to garner the support and protection of the collective - which likely led to our ancestors surviving and reproducing.

Therefore, I think you’re deluded if you think you can override thousands of years of evolutionary programming by simply willing yourself to not allow certain kinds of satiation that your mind is hardwired to crave. The average cannot help but be average unless they’re at a special company that doesn’t suffer from the usual, monumental, delusion we find within companies (and my hunch is the number of such companies can be counted on my two hands).

This is also why many scientists fear the hit of the Nobel prize because the monumental “hit” that such external validation gives you warps your conditioning subconsciously to optimize for that hit again. Everything truth you observe, understand, value, predict will be towards the hit rather than towards understanding your field of study better. And the same goes for any popular award for any field of human endeavor, or even status on social media. Interestingly, the ones that don’t fear it seem to be the ones most affected by it.

- But, there’s another problem as well: the more proxies between you and reality, the less valuable feedback becomes.

### Greats are paranoid about what satiates them

→ In other words, they’re paranoid about how their minds are conditioned.

→ Average founder vs. great founder.

The average usually isn’t that paranoid because if they were, they probably wouldn’t have put themselves on the path t

---

### Greats have intuition

_“The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant”_ - Einstein.

Intellectualization falls short.

You cannot effectively seek truth with rational thinking alone. It simply will not work for difficult wants because there are too many factors. This is why I’ve categorized it separately from seeking - it is a necessary aid to be able to act in our world, but it is far from the most valuable tool we have, and not acknowledging this is one of the greatest mistakes novices and the average make.

The crux:

- Intuition must be precisely explained in terms of **observe, understand, value, and predict**. And show how this drastically outperforms
- See observations the average cannot see. Understand observations in ways that the average cannot. Value function is more subtle, and prediction leads to sub-branches that are simply more fruitful - that won’t even arrive in the mind of the average.
  - Perhaps it will arrive after spending a lot of time, but that’s not clear, and my hunch is that the time required is much longer than most people are willing to put up with.

→ The Steve Jobs example vs. an employee at Apple.

→ The top tier scientist approach vs. the average scientist.

→ A great filmmaker vs. the average one.

→ The average will realize the gap once they try to do something great.

### Yet, even greats become outdated

Many seem to think this is because it’s tougher to exert themselves or because their minds aren’t as sharp, etc. But I believe the primary reason greats become outdated is because their intuition turns into bias.

Conditioning that worked for them at one point eventually stop working to help them get what they want.

---

### Truths expire (change)

Intuition becomes bias because every truth has an expiry date when it will cease to be true. _(note: in all likelihood, even the truths about our universe, and physical world will likely expire at some point - just far beyond any practical timeline - there is no evidence to believe they won’t, and the safer belief is to believe that the truths of the universe follow the same pattern as any other truths we’ve uncovered)._

---

### Intuition turns into bias

(Need to reference theory of mind in which we see how conditioning happens every moment).

We’re becoming more biased by the moment.

And there’s only so much we can do to prevent this.

Can’t the great just focus on conditioning towards the truths that don’t expire? This is a great strategy - one that the master employs. But, the challenge is that it’s impossible to operate only on timeless beliefs.

To get what you want from the world, you need to meet it where it is, not where you want it to be.

→ A filmmaker that makes a ‘1910’s style film with outdated language and cultural references, likely won’t appeal to the current world (even themselves! as they too are conditioned by the modern world) - likely won’t make something they like, and by extension others appreciate.

→ An entrepreneur that doesn’t meet the world where it is today, no matter how well they understand the nature of the mind and the root cause for the problem they’re trying to solve, can’t build their product in a way that the world accepts it.

You can’t avoid believing in temporary truths because most truths we operate on are temporary.

<aside>
💡 Therefore, intuition is guaranteed to turn into bias at the rate at which the truths you rely on expire.

</aside>

### Progress accelerates rate at which truths expire.

- Really dive into what this means with parables, and talk about how unintuitive it is.
- We aren’t evolved to handle this.

Truths always expired, but they didn’t expire nearly as quickly as they do today.

Even as recent as a few decades ago, you could continue to get what you want by allowing yourself to condition yourself deeply to your beliefs.

- That strategy no longer works.

- GDP is a lagging indicator of the value of truths we have collectively uncovered, but it is still an indicator. How much it lags depends on our collective speed at which we can turn ideas into reality.

---

### Our delusion grows every moment.

- This is actually a solid point. It shows just how flawed we are in a sense. Powerful. There is a nice few paras here that are incredibly powerful.

---

### The average will be outdated from the start

- Only the novice, greats and masters will be valued.
- Novice ought to figure out path to mastery and do their best to skip the average stage entirely. - unfortunately our world is designed to train for the average. Modern education has many, many proxies between a student and reality, leading to the biases of teachers and modern day “experts” passing onto students like a deadly virus - a virus more harmful than any pandemic we’ve ever experienced or will experience.
- A great example: imagine someone training to become good at Chess or Go, and every minute the rules of the game change in some way. Sometimes the change is small, sometimes it’s massive. (You can really dive into this example - it’s a great thought experiment).

---

### Average does not lead to great

The longer you stay average, the more difficult it becomes for you to be great.
Stagnation is an illusion.

Most of us drastically miscalculate risk. (Talk about how when people decide to take any path that has more proxies to reality, they don't take into account how the mind conditions itself to the path and becomes significantly more deluded than if they had interfaced more closely with reality).

---

### Paradox: skyrocketing salaries alongside a massive job crunch

- Show how this is already here.
- Predict how this will become more pronounced (and I predict this will happen even if we fix education).

---

### Conditioning is becoming more important than ability to act.

---

### A master has better control over their conditioning

- And this isn’t through sheer willpower - as we saw earlier, willpower only works for conditioning you can see, but not the conditioning that you’re blind to. (reference the piece above).
- They have choice over how they are conditioned.

  - Even greats are smart enough to put themselves in situations that minimize satiation that goes against what they want, but a master has control over how strongly they are satiated.
  - This means a master can choose to condition or de-condition their mind at will:
  - They have a set of techniques, both individual and collaborative that minimize their delusions.
  - (The first step to control is to see it!) And they can see their conditioning more clearly than the rest of us. They’re skillful in navigating their outdated conditioning that prevents them from getting what they want.

  The key point here is: two people with the same exact experiences and everything can still differ in how strongly their mind is conditioned in a particular way. I.e. strong beliefs weakly held is precisely this.

---

### We don’t even know what we want (conditioning is blinding)

- Intellectual understanding ≠ knowing because conditioning is not intellectual.
- The mind will make the jump from “I’m voting for X” to “I am X” without you even realizing. The mind wants to latch onto things quickly and fiercely. Countering this tendency isn’t as easy as it may seem at first glance. (not sure how this point applies here - but it’s a critical point).
- Conscious vs. subconscious.

Going back to the example of the Nobel laureate who can’t do good work [anymore](http://anymore.In): in most situations the right truth seeking move is to operate in ways that our outdated conditioning latches onto.

For example, becoming popular feeds self-preservation, but is also incredibly valuable for seeking truth: it allows the world to criticize your ideas, which helps you improve more quickly. But it also sets a massive trap: the more you allow the popularity to satiate you, the more you’ll be derailed from getting what you consciously want.

I suspect that when we think we want to be great at something, what we actually want is to simply become great at something that people appreciate - and that could be anything.

---

### Masters crave even faster change

The average feel that world is changing too fast. Greats embrace it. Masters crave even faster change.

- Masters don’t crave more change for sadistic reasons, but rather because they know that more change leads to faster improvement and less suffering for the world. More rapid change means that we’ll more quickly have improvements for all human problems - from global warming, diseases, etc. The slower the world changes, the longer we hold onto our problems that cause immense suffering for most that live in the world.
- This doesn’t mean that everyone that craves more change is a master, but the point is that the master benefits from change in ways that no one else does.
- And greater change in the direction things are changing in, means that masters will have better tools at their disposal to seek truth and get what they want.

---

### Seeking truth is the only skill

- Ability to act will be democratized.
- Human progress equalizes ability to act (i.e. gives everyone greater leverage). Acknowledge the significant lack of equality of opportunity, but show that it’s rapidly evolving in the right direction.
- Human progress isn’t just technology. It’s culture, politics, decentralization, etc. as well. All the world wants is to maximize transactions, creating the necessary incentives to create equal opportunity.

---

### A master’s skill is more generalizable than the great’s

---

### A master is also deluded

Just less than others, due to the limitations of our own minds: the rate at which we process information, the information we are exposed to, the depth of the conditoinings we are born with.

But, with progress, these limitations will become smaller, amplifying our ability to seek truth.

---

### Our potential

- The efficient market hypothesis paints a deluded picture of the world.
- Draw a bar with the top being the best we can do, and a line towards the top that shows where we are, in this moment in time. This efficient market hypothesis makes you believe that we are much higher than reality.
- In reality: the line is too close to the bottom to even represent the difference with one pixel, and therefore it could not even be drawn on your screen. Yes, that’s how fucking off we are from what we could be. The human potential.
- Most valuable truths are not uncovered.
- We know barely anything.
- Believing in progress is an act of humility.

### Mapping every day advice, knowledge to the terms we've used

Clearly if our model doesn't explain commonly used concepts that are likely true, then we're probably wrong somewhere.

Focus = memory + willpower. Steve Jobs was right about “focus is about saying no”.

Resilience = willpower to resist your conditioning that wants to push you away from a scenario that doesn’t have satiation.

Judgement = Seeking truth well so that your beliefs are aligned with reality, valuable, and so that you have a more granular notion of values of truths, so that you can prioritize effectively. And

Self-awareness = the ability to see (in this context this would be “feel” since conditioning manifests as a feeling) how your mind is conditioned.

Good taste = having good conditioning such that your mind produces good predictions.

Discernment = having good conditioning such that your value function is more granular: you can see the difference between the value of two beliefs whereas others would see them as equal.

And there is more: can map every bias / fallacy to our terms: (confirmation bias, sunken cost fallacy, etc.)

### Concluding thoughts

I hope by now we're aligned on how important the ability to seek truth is, how it is the essence of any skill we value, and just how terribly difficult it is to be good at it. We have a glimpse of what the stages of mastery look like, but it's still quite unclear what is the best training strategy is - to become a master at seeking truth.

That's the focus of my next essay. It's a nuanced, difficult path. Fortunately, we have masters in the our world today, and in the past, that we can study to make sense of how they developed their mastery.

This journey to understand how to become a master will also involve grounding our theory of mind in neurobiology. After all, if a master has greater control over how their mind is conditioned, then we need to dive deeper into understanding what conditioning even is. My current model of conditioning as I shared in this essay is far from having the accuracy required in order to describe the path to mastery.

I also believe the path to mastery is far from a solo path. It's incredibly difficult to see our own delusions and conditionings that prevent us from seeing reality as it is, and therefore friends that can show us our delusions are invaluable. So, understanding the path to mastery will also require studying what it means to collaborate and to make friends on our path to mastering seeking truth.

I need your feedback! Especially if you have any life experiences or beliefs that contradict with the theories I've proposed above. Certainly my theories are deluded to some degree, because I'm an incredibly deluded person, as are you. But the beauty of our species is that you and I are bound to be deluded differently. So your feedback can help show me my own delusions. Please be as critical as you can be. I'll be grateful for it.

(TODO): a link for how to give me feedback.

(Something about compassion, love, etc. and how that isn't seeking truth - but it is. Even compassion can be cultivated, trained if you seek truth about how. But why? Because we are more peaceful as a result. So, even if you want to be happier, more compassionate, seeking truth is the technique. And just like how deluded we are at all the things we want, we are even more deluded about what it means to feel peace, and how to attain it. But that isn't the focus of my essays at the moment. I care more about worldly pursuits: how to get what you want in the world, to solve our collective external problems. When we've become sufficiently good at that, I'll likely shift my attention to seeking truth about inner peace).
