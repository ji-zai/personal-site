title: Seeking truth is the only skill

I started writing this essay to get a sense for what the most valuable skills will be in a future in which AI becomes incredibly powerful. As I spent more time exploring this question I realized that any valuable skill, at its core, is either a process of seeking the truth about the world we live in, or about ourselves. 

And I believe even that distinction (internal vs. external) is only intellectual. Our ability to seek truth about the world we live in is directly, greatly, impacted by our ability to seek truth about ourselves. After all, your mind is your lens into the world; you can't trust it without understanding it.

As AI becomes more powerful, the ability to seek truth will be the only skill that matters.
## I) Seeking truth
### What does "seeking truth" mean?

By "truth" I mean some property or rule we can observe about a system that exists in reality.

By "system", I mean anything that has some phenomena, or things happening in it. It doesn't matter whether you can observe those things or not. Before we had the microscope we couldn't observe the microscopic properties of biological systems, but those properties of course existed.

The world we live in is made of such systems: physical, biological, chemical, etc.

By "seeking truth", I mean the quest to understand the properties / rules of any system. 

I love the word "seek" because I think it perfectly encapsulates a truth about seeking truth: it is a process of iteration that can only better approximate the reality of a system, without ever reaching it. If you ever reach complete understanding of a system, you've "found" truth, which is clearly far from being the case for most, if not all, systems we've encountered in nature.
### What's the point of seeking truth? 

Well, if you have no wants, and are perfectly content with everything, there would be no point to seeking truth.

Two characteristics of our minds gives purpose to seeking truth: we want, and we want to get what we want as quick as possible.

The things we want are part of systems, and so, the more quickly we can seek truths about the systems that govern our wants, the more quickly we can get what we want. (note: even curiosity, a want to simply uncover truths about a system, is still a want).

Understanding how a system works gives you power over it, because more often than not it means you can get what you want from it, more quickly.

Technically, time is the only thing that is scarce for us. All other resources are only scarce to the extent that we don't yet sufficiently understand the systems that govern those resources to be able to extract them efficiently.

(note: time is not scarce because we will die someday, but rather because of the second characteristic of the mind: to want to get what it wants as quickly as possible. Even if we solve aging somehow, time will still be scarce for us as a result of this nature of our minds).

Our visible universe has an abundance of energy, water, and any other resource that we depend on. Seeking truth is how we will learn to extract these resources such that they are no longer scarce for us.
### Clearly seeking truth is valuable. But is it a skill?

An action is a skill when it has some notion of "goodness": there is a better and worse way to perform that action.

In the context of seeking truth, goodness correlates with how quickly you can seek truth about a system. (note: speed is the only quality that matters because time is our only scarcity).

Which means, if it's possible to be better at seeking truth for a system, you're able to get what you want out of that system faster.

Let's see why seeking truth is a skill by using a contrived example.

Let's take a system that is a function f(x) = y. This function takes an argument (the variable x), and returns some value: y.

Let's say that this is the first time we've encountered this system, and we have no idea what values it returns for any given value of x.

And so, in this simple system, the process of seeking truth about it is to simply figure out what the function is.

And we will seek truth by "executing" the function with different values of x until we're confident that we know what the function is (i.e. what "y" is).

Let's take two people Alice and Bob, who want to seek truth about this system of a function.

Bob starts by executing the function with the value 1 (a natural first choice) and sees that the function also outputs the number 1.

Bob concludes that the function must be f(x) = 1, writes it down, shares it with the world to claim that he uncovered the truth about this system.

Alice starts by executing the function with 1 as well and sees that the function also outputs 1. Alice makes no conclusion about this because she feels that she doesn't yet know the behavior of this system well enough to be able to conclusively say that she's uncovered its truth.

Alice continues to observe how the system behaves by executing it with more values.

She tries 0 this time and observes the system show 0.
She then tries 2, and observes 2.

By this point, she thinks the function may be f(x) = x with some confidence.

She then tries -1, and observes 1.

She realizes her mistake and now she thinks it might be f(x) = absolute_value(x)

She then tries -2, and observes 2.
### Absolute truths are rare; only iteratively increasing confidence in truths.

The more numbers she tries, the more confidently she believes f(x) = absolute_value(x).

The more values she observes, the more confident she becomes in the truth she's uncovered.

After having sufficient confidence, she shares with the world that she believes the system's behaviors is represented by the function f(x) = absolute_value(x), and shows her observations so that others can verify and give her feedback.

In this example, it's clear that Bob wasn't just wrong, but that he was terrible at seeking truth. While Alice on the other hand was better than Bob.

Now, let's say that the system was actually: f(x) = 1! This means Bob was right and discovered the truth more quickly than Alice, even though Alice was better than Bob at seeking truth.

The only reasonable explanation for this is luck.
### There is an element of luck, but it converges to nothing as a system becomes more complex and unknown.

It's clear that even though Bob might have discovered the truth about the system earlier than Alice, Alice was more skilled in seeking truth than Bob because Alice is more likely to discover truth more quickly than Bob as the behavior of system become more complicated, or less likely to match how we feel the system might work.

- Something about the only luck that will remain is Alice's health: how long can she keep studying this system. If she's hit by a car tomorrow, yes that would still be quite unlucky, and skill in truth seeking in a particular system likely can't prevent that sort of misfortune.
### Not all truths are created equal.

In this example, the following are all truths about the system:
1. f(1) = 1 (very high confidence)
2. f(2) = 2 (very high confidence)
3. f(-1) = -1 (very high confidence)
4. f(-2) = -2 (very high confidence)
5. f(0) = 0 (very high confidence)
6. f(x) = x (reasonable confidence)

Yet, the value of the last truth is significantly higher than all of the truths above because it gives you predictive power: it tells you the behavior of the system for things you haven't yet observed in the system.

In the systems of the world, we've found that truths follow a power law: the more valuable truths are orders of magnitudes more valuable than the least valuable truths.

And when a more "fundamental" or general truth is uncovered with reasonable confidence, it replaces many less fundamental truths because they can all be derived from the more fundamental truth.

In other words, the process of seeking truths about a system is to uncover the most fundamental truths that can be used to predict the entire behavior of the system.
### Truth seeking skill follows a power law.

When truths follow a power law, and the most valuable truths are orders of magnitude more powerful than the least, it naturally follows that a truth seeker who is better than another by a linear factor, will have exponentially greater results.

In the system above, 
### Skill in seeking truth generalizes to any system.
### Is there an upper limit to how good you can be at seeking truth?
### What stops us from seeking truth optimally?
### Self-delusion is the greatest obstacle to being great at seeking truth.

## II) Self-delusion is the greatest delusion
### The mind operates in two modes: thinking & feeling.

### Thinking is grounded in feeling.

### Sensitivity is how much you're aware of what you're feeling.
This implies that there's some feelings that are happening that you can't feel right now.
### You feel a lot more than you think you do.
- There are probably studies out there that measure the feelings a person has (measured on body), vs. what they think they feel. Reference them.
- Talk about my personal experience: the more sensitive I've made my mind, the more I see what I'm feeling, and I can say confidently that there have been many moments in the past when I felt that I was "balanced" or not aggravated or feeling anything, I was extremely self-deluded. (Key moment: when someone says calm down and I scream back "I'm calm!" - no one's stupid enough to really believe that in hindsight, yet we all have the tendency to say that - clearly self-deluded in the moment).
### Our delusion about what we're feeling holds us back from seeking truth optimally.
- Impatience is rooted in feeling.
- Procrastination is rooted in feeling.
- Lying ( / fraud) is rooted in feeling.

To be clear, I don't mean that feeling itself is useless. I actually don't think it's possible (or at least I haven't yet experienced) to feel absolutely nothing. There's always some feeling, so it's a matter of what feelings are more aligned with seeking truth?

In my personal experience, I've found a feeling of calm and compassion to be the most productive feelings to cultivate. Why? Because they help me see the grander purpose of what I'm doing, who I'm working for, and what my work could enable in others.

It's in this peace that I'm able to be more free in my imaginations and thinking.

For example, I'm willing to bet that if Einstein was constantly wound up and agitated over getting some award or being recognized, he wouldn't have done great research.

My hunch is that he had to be sufficiently balanced to give space to the seemingly tame, random questions about how the world works to even enter his mind.

Many people talk about the "flow" state of mind when they're fully absorbed in the work they're doing. If you think back to when you were in that state, would you characterize it as intense and agitated or more relaxed and at peace - as if the work was happening on its own? I'd bet the latter.

So it's not feeling that's the issue, it's certain feelings that more intensely cloud our view of reality that's the issue.
### Collective delusion compounds exponentially.

- There is a beautiful equation here that demonstrates the exponential nature of increase in delusion when you add an additional member to the team.
- There is also a point to be made about the "weakest link": one sufficiently self-deluded teammate can bring the entire team down.
- Talk about how companies fail as a consequence of collective delusion. Use the terminology from "What stops us from seeking truth optimally" section above - which list out all the ways in which we can be deluded about a system.
### Bias != intuition. (TODO: seek truth about this)

## III) Why seeking truth is the only skill
### Seeking truth doesn't generalize fully, but only to the medium of observation.

I was wrong above when I said that skill in seeking truth generalizes to any system. It only generalizes to the medium of observation.
### Seeking truth well requires seeking truth in both mediums: thinking and feeling.
- Understanding your own feelings enables you to understand others' feelings as well.
- Mirror neurons: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22957393/
- Empathy = sensitivity to your own feelings which start to mirror others' when you engage with them.
### Exponential rise in technology will make seeking truth the only skill that remains.
### All valuable skills are derived from the ability to seek truth.
### "Truth seeker" is the most robust identity.
### AI will show us what makes us human.
### How do we create a truth seeking world?

## Notes
- Those that seek truth in feelings have a more difficult time building a team that sustains the test of time because feelings are far more difficult to communicate than thinking. (is this true? Is it more likely for Studio Ghibli to fail than it is for, say, Google? - yeah, this isn't that clear).
- Those that sufficiently understand how the mind works, can only wish for peace the world.
