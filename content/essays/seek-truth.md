## On seeking truth
### intro

To seek truth is to understand the reality of the world we live in so that we can get what we want out of it.

Seeking truth has been the most important skill in human history that has led to the progress we’ve had a species.

I believe that as AI becomes more powerful, seeking truth will be the only skill that matters.

This essay is my attempt to understand what seeking truth actually means, what stops us from being good at it, and how rapid technological evolution impacts us.
### What is truth?

A truth is the reality of a system. A system can be anything.

For now, let’s think of a truth as a statement about a system, represented by a sequence of English characters.

Note: the statement does not have to be falsifiable, it simply needs to be aligned with reality.

- For example: the statement: “After death you will meet a person who will decide whether you go to heaven or hell” is a statement that is not falsifiable, but would be a truth if that is what actually happens after death. Of course, most of us would discard such claims because we have no way of testing it.
- In other words, a truth has nothing to do with us - i.e. it exists whether we take note of it, whether we believe it, whether we can even see it, etc.

Seeking truth only makes sense in the context of a human (because without a human, the truth just exists, there’s no need to “seek” it.). A human wants and wants to get what they want as quickly as possible. Therefore, in order

Therefore, seeking truth is the process of: ___.

### Why seek truth?

- Seeking truth is how you get what you want as quickly as possible.
- And seeking truth is how, as a species, we will get what we want.
- Time is our only scarcity, in theory everything else we need is in abundance. The only thing we lack is sufficient understanding of the truths that govern the systems to extract those resources. There is no reason to believe that we cannot do this.
- Human progress till now has depended on our ability to seek truth about the systems that govern our wants. (A quick look at history).
### Truths are uncovered in chunks

When you try to understand how a system works, you won’t be able to build a complete understanding of it all at once, rather it’s an iterative process.

You uncover truths one after the other, and as you do, you develop a more complete understanding of the system you’re seeking the truth about.
### A truth has a sense of value.

- Similar to the “similarity function”, our “value” function is also subjective (one person’s trash is treasure for another), but it’s different for a very different reason: not some inherent difference in how we cluster truths, but rather due to differences in wants.
- A person with the same want, at same magnitude will eventually converge on the same value for a truth. (This is good - this also applies for clustering!).
- Take the example of all world leaders who want to keep their civilization alive will eventually value the truths about a nuclear weapon similarly (given enough truth seeking).
- For the sake of discussion, let’s use a number to denote what the value of a truth is for a given person.

To see what this looks like in practice, let’s use an example: a person, Alice, who wants to get across a body of water, who doesn't know anything about how to do so.
### Truths are clustered

Similarity function: a sense of similarity between truths.

To be clear, similarity and clustering also only make sense when we view it from the perspective of a person because of how we’ve defined it. It is subjective, and I think this way of looking at it makes sense given how there are many example of people who see connections between two truths that others don’t see.

Each of us likely has a different clusterings of truths because we have different “similarity functions”.
### We have an internal model for what we think the truths are.

Each row in the inner model is:
- truth (our truths)
- confidence
- value

Delusion = difference between what we think the truth is and what reality is.

So the overall delusion in our model is a sum of all the individual delusions of all the truths we believe, multiplied by the confidence we have in each respective truth.

Why multiply by our confidence in the truth? Well, if we’re actually deluded about a truth, and we have a very low confidence in that truth, then we’re not as deluded as in the case where we’re actually deluded about a truth, but have a high confidence in it.

**The entire process of seeking truth is to maximize the value of our model, while minimizing its delusion.**

Both are required. High value with high delusion is useless. Low value with low delusion is useless, but at least has a path to getting better.

Worst is high delusion.
Better is lower delusion low value.
Best is low delusion and high value.

(Ground all of the above using the same example)
### Truth seeking happens iteratively.

(Animation showing how the model is updated).
### Seeking truth is to observe, understand, and predict.

To **observe** is to "see" something happen.

To **understand** is to interpret what we've observed and update our inner model to reflect it.

For example, we could observe something that invalidates a truth we believe and so we update our inner model that negates the truth statement.

Or we observe something that reinforces a hunch that we have, and we increase the confidence for that truth.

Understanding is like a reaction to an observation, and can impact multiple truths in our model as part of the re-orienting of that inner model.

To **predict** is to extrapolate our understanding 

(Need to speak to the importance of prediction, and how without it the learning process is killed - i.e. takes much longer than required).

Some people say that these happen in a cycle, but I think it’s quite a messy process. Sometimes a prediction will lead to an experiment to enable the observation that tests the prediction, but just as often a prediction can be followed by a subconscious observation rising to the conscious mind out of seemingly nowhere, etc.

Which is why I think it’s safer to call to call an iteration any update to the model. It doesn’t matter what the order of the operations are, an update is an update if your model changes.
### Seeking truth happens consciously and subconsciously.

This will require some time to explain, do this at a high level, will dig into it in detail in the next section.
### It takes effort to seek truth, but effort itself is not truth seeking.

This is actually more profound than I first thought. You ought not to be attached to the effort / pain it takes to seek truth. That itself is a hindrance. Just as the Buddha didn’t benefit from overly starving himself (by following the thought that hurting yourself is the path to truth).

(A good truth seeker cares about reducing effort without attachment to the effort itself).

### Everything is changing, all at once.

- Every component of the process, including what you want, is constantly changing, all the time.
- Make the claim that this change is happening every moment whether you realize it or not.
- This is an incredibly important point. It will be a valuable reference in the next section where I dig into the mind.
### How much does luck factor?

This is actually quite tough to understand. There seem to be too many factors at play. But I do think you can show how the factor of luck reduces the more iterations that take place.
### Seeking truth is a skill.

Firstly, what makes something a skill?
Why are the differences so pronounced?

The skill that matters is experiential, not intellectual.
You can't train this skill by simply reading a book or even listening to someone else's experiences.

What are the aspects of the skill?
- Accurately assessing the value of a truth. (i.e. correctly prioritizing).
- Maximizing the speed at which confidence is increased while minimizing delusion.
- Designing your wants to not limit your view. (this goes even further into designing your own identity to not limit your view)
- Knowing when to shift attention to reducing effort (speed up iteration), and when to shift back to the core truth seeking.
- Knowing when to stop generating predictions and go execute / knowing when to keep generating more predictions because there is a significantly better approach that is worth the wait.

The skill is experiential, not intellectual.

(Todo: there's a great example here with the fear that comes from burning your hand in fire, and how in the future even smelling something burning jolts you into caution, whereas the person who only understands it theoretically doesn't have a similar reaction).
### The skill is experiential, not intellectual.

(This should be above when you talk about how it’s a skill)
### What stops us from seeking truth effectively?

- Local vs. global maxima. (this probably deserves its own section)
- Limiting wants.
- Complacency.
- Delusion.
## Self-delusion is the greatest impediment
## Seeking truth is the only thing that remains

### How technology impacts seeking truth

## Notes

### Training in truth seeking must be experiential. (Learn by doing).
- Every single thing in (“what exactly is the skill”) is achieved through the realm of feeling. You simply cannot have a hard and fast rule for it.
### Impact of exponential rise in technology:
(Following happen in tandem with power of technology:)
- Value of truth seeking will increase.
- Penalty of dogma will increase.
- Penalty of delusion will increase.
### Want does not imply imbalance of the mind.
- This is a common misconception that needs to be thoroughly debunked.
### Skill in seeking truth follows a power law.

(I might be able to shove this into the section on the impact of technology on truth seeking, and society at large). -> This is in act 3 (why seeking truth is the ONLY skill).

What is the right example to use to build this on?
- A person who wants to get across a body of water.
