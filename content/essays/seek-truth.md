title: Seeking truth is the only skill
date: April 2024

To seek truth is to understand the realities of the world we live in so that we can get what we want from it.

It's always been an important process for us, yet the majority of us didn't need to do this in order to be able to live somewhat comfortable lives. There were a variety of activities that were possible in order to contribute to our families and society.

Soon, I believe seeking truth will be the only thing we have left to do.

This essay is my attempt to understand what seeking truth actually means with all the nuance and precision required to see what matters, understand how the world is changing and what that means for us.

What is a truth?

A truth is a reality of a system. A system is anything that has some phenomena happening inside of it. Physics, biology, chemistry, are all systems with varying events, characteristics and rules that govern them.

Because a truth is aligned with reality, it exists whether someone observes it, understands it, or even agrees with it. Gravity exists regardless of what anyone thinks about it.

For now, let’s think of a truth as a statement that’s represented by a sequence of English characters. A statement is true to the degree that it’s aligned with reality.

It’s possible for me to believe a statement is true, even though it's not aligned with reality. Let’s call this gap, our “delusion”. Our delusion is the difference between what we think the truth is, and what the truth actually is.

And so seeking truth is the process of understanding a system as it exists in reality / reducing our delusion about a system.

The word “seek” means “try to find”. I think this describes the process of seeking truth well. Seeking truth only gets you closer to the truth. We’ve yet to “find” the truth about any naturally occurring system, and from what we can tell, we understand very, very little of what is possible to understand. There is always more truth to be uncovered.

Why seek truth?

The nature of our minds dictates that we want things, and we want to get what we want as quickly as possible.

And therefore, time is the only resource that is scarce for us. It's not scarce because we will die, but because we want to get what we want as quickly as possible. Even if we solve aging, time will continue to be a scarcity for us.

Seeking truth isn’t useful if you don’t want things and want to get what you want as quickly as possible. If you want something and don’t care when you’ll get it, and if you have infinite time, then you can simply try random things and you’ll eventually get what you want.

But if you care about getting what you want quickly, you’ll need to understand the systems that govern what you want so that you can work more productively to get what you want as quickly as possible.

Therefore, seeking truth gives you power to get what you want.

(note: even curiosity is a want: a want to understand something simply for the sake of understanding it. Even those that are curious would want to understand something as quickly as they can, and therefore seeking truth would be valuable to them as well.)

From the perspective of our species, all resources that are currently scarce for humans, except time, exist in abundance in the universe: energy, the components that make water, food, light, etc.

And so, the only that prevents us from solving all of humanity's problems (note: external) is our lack of understanding of the systems that govern these resources. And we gain that understanding by seeking truth.

So clearly seeking truth is incredibly valuable. Our progress as a species is grounded in our ability to seek truth about the world we live in, and about ourselves.

But, I think we're far from being as good as we can be at seeking truth. If there is such a thing as optimal truth seeking, which I believe exists as we'll explore later, then we are orders of magnitude away from where we could be.

We're so far from our potential because we don't culturally prioritize truth seeking to the extent that we could, and, more importantly, because most of us don't understand (even intellectually) what seeking truth even means with sufficient nuance and precision that's required to become great at it.

(note: This essay surprised me because of how much I learned about seeking truth by seeking the truth about it through writing. If I was close to the average person in the world in terms of my understanding of seeking truth before writing this essay, and just slightly above average after writing this, then I believe we have a lot, lot of room for improvement)

A truth has a sense of value.

From nature's perspective, things just exist, and value is a feature of a being that wants something. If you have no wants, there's no sense to value one truth over another.

How you value a truth depends on what you want. The value corresponds to how much you believe that truth will enable you to get what you want.

Therefore, you'd value one truth more than another if it gets you more of what you want, more quickly.

Predictive power and relevance determine a truth's value.

Predictive power is how much that truth tells about the systems that govern your want, in a way that enables you to act on it.

There are two aspects to this predictive power: fundamentality, and precision.

For someone building a bridge, the truth about the formula for gravity is far more valuable than the truth: "when you throw something up, it will fall back down".

From the perspective of this engineer, both are true, but the formula for gravity tells them a lot more about the system they're operating in. They're able to predict how the system will behave without having to see that behavior.

They can tell a lot more because they can derive a variety of behaviors from the formula for gravity. A truth is more fundamental the more things that can be derived from it.

The know what forces will act on the bridge and can therefore plan for it without having to go through the process of building something that doesn't work, having it break, and then learning from it. This is invaluable.

For a truth to have power, it also needs to be precise. Precision is having enough detail to be actionable.

For example: "Ai is going to greatly change the world" is far weaker of a truth than knowing exactly how it will impact the world, in which ways. The person that believes the former may lead the person to learn more about AI, and perhaps make a few good long term investments. A person that knows the latter will be able to help build the future of AI.

In a way, precision is required for a truth to be fundamental as well. An overly generic truth can't be used to derive anything from it. So these are different ways of describing what at the end of the day is simply predictive power.

Yet, a powerful truth is useless to someone if it doesn't help them get what they want, i.e. it's not relevant to them.

For a person in a village who desperately needs to build a boat to get across a large body of water, e = mc^2 isn't valuable at all, even though it is an incredibly powerful truth that tells a lot about the world we live in.

Therefore, relevancy is critical for a person to value a truth.

Another way to look at it is:
- Relevancy is how aligned it is with your want.
- Power is the magnitude of the truth.

It may seem that the way a person values a truth is purely subjective, and changes from person to person. That is mostly true, but there is objectivity to this as well.

Two people with the same want, with sufficient time to seek truth about the systems that govern their want, will eventually converge towards the same values for truths pertaining to those systems.

For example, world leaders who want to keep their countries safe would all value greatly the truths about how nuclear weapons operate.

Therefore, from here on out, I'll refer to the "true value" of a truth for a given want to be the value that someone who has the want, and a complete understanding of all the systems that govern that want, would assign to this truth.

It's easy to see how the "true value" often differs from the value we associate with a truth.

For example (show an example of someone who discovers something for the first time thinks it's a game changing breakthrough, that is stupidly valuable, but it's only after you discover something more powerful that you learn to put the previously highly valued truth in its place. Or even better: what seems like an unnecessary truth today, may actually be an incredibly valuable once sufficient understanding ripens in adjacent systems).

And we've found in practice that the values of truths follow the power law: the most valuable truths are orders of magnitudes more valuable than the least valuable ones. (note: may need to substantiate this a bit more).

(Todo: patience definitely has a role to play in the value function. If you're being chased by a tiger and all you want is to find a way to escape, only the truths that enable immediate escape are valued, and all values for all other truths go down to 0 for as long as you feel like your life is in danger - def need to find a way to work this into the model).

There's also a sense of similarity between two truths.

For a person who wants to get across a lake, the truths: "wood floats on water", and "a sail can propel with wind", are far more similar than the truth "gold sinks in water" is with either of them.

Why is that? Because a person who wants to get across a body of water is probably not going to predict something about the floating nature of gold in water, as it's so unrelated to what they want. Similarly, they wouldn't predict the kind of insects that live in the wood after they understand "wood floats on water".

In other words, the similarity between two truths is the likelihood of you predicting one as a reaction to the understanding of the other.

Similarity doesn't seem to fully depend on the value the truths. You won't always predict truths that are valuable, and more often than not you'll predict a bunch of truths that are useless before you start to predict more useful ones. 

So similarity(t1, t2) and value(t) seem to be independent functions.

Similarity also impacts what you observe, because an observation can be a reaction to a prediction, and so if the similarity function determines prediction, it will impact observation since you'll only create experiments for what you predict. (note: what about the observation that is a direction reaction to a want and not a prediction?)

This similarity function creates "clusters" of truths. Therefore, as you seek truth, you'll tend to understand it in clusters.

Over time, as you understand more of the systems that govern your want, you'll realize that some clusters are much closer than you initially thought they were. (todo: show a good example for this).

Similar to the value function, there is a sense of objectivity to the similarity function, or in other words there's a "true similarity" between two truths, for a given want.

Two individuals with the same want, given infinite time to seek truth, will eventually converge on the same similarity function.

They'd have no choice but to see the similarity between two truths that initially seemed far apart if those two truths work together to help them get what they want.

For example, most people thought that the truths about rubber and metal were two "far apart" clusters of truths until we invented tools and materials that utilized both (like car tires). 

Then, they became more similar truths. When someone thinks about how to use rubber to get what they want, they're now more likely to think about the truths about metals as a way to reinforce the rubber in more useful ways. (todo: there's definitely a better example, but this conveys the gist of what I'm trying to get at).

We live with an internal model of what we believe is true, and this model determines how we act in the world. We act according to our model in order to get the things that we want.

For now, let's think of this model as a spreadsheet with many rows, each corresponding to a truth you believe in.

Each row would have the following columns:
1. Your truth (a statement).
2. Confidence (how much you believe that your truth is actually aligned with reality).
3. Value (how much you value this truth).

The "value" field of each row depends on what you want in that moment. And of course, you only value a truth if it helps you fulfill what you want in that moment. Which means that each time our want changes, the values in our model are updated to reflect our value for the new want.

You might ask what happens when we want multiple things at once. I believe the mind focuses on one want at a time, and the feeling that we can multi-task probably exists because we're not aware of the jumps between wants that the mind is always making - sometimes within a single second.

(side note:
An interesting example is what I experienced just now: I was typing a word in the above paragraph, felt some hunger, wanted some food - all while not stopping the typing. And then my mind noticed a spelling mistake in my typing and my current want shifted to wanting to to fix it, leading me to hit backspaces and re-type.

Even in this small window of typing a word, my stomach growled, my mind wanted food, and then saw that I made a typo and then jumped back to wanting to fix it. I don't think those wants happened simultaneously, but because of the short duration in which it happened, it may seem so. But if they didn't happen simultaneously, how did my fingers keep typing while I was wanting something else other than to write the next word? I think because we can do things mindlessly without actively wanting, just how we can drive a car without wanting to.

The presence of mindless action that is fulfilling a previous want doesn't disprove that the mind can only want one thing at a time.
)

But even if you believe otherwise (that there are multiple "threads" so to speak), understanding how a single thread operates should at least be directionally illuminating.

So, what happens when we want something?

The mind recollects the highest value truth for this want that it has. But clearly this truth doesn't always suffice in helping you get what you want, so there has to be some notion of a "requirement" for a want, such that if your highest valued truth for a given want doesn't meet the requirement for your want, you have to find another way to fulfill your want.

For example: you're on your phone and you feel hunger (a want for food). The top value truth in your head is that there's a large sandwich in your fridge that you know will satiate your hunger. Because the top value truth meets the requirement of your want, you're able to act on your model without needing to improve it, to fulfill your want - by eating that sandwich.

In other words, the state of your model for this want, in this moment, is powerful enough to fulfill it.

But, it could be that you believed there's a sandwich in the fridge, but when you went and opened it, the sandwich wasn't there. Clearly what we believe to be true may not be aligned with reality.

Let's call this misalignment with reality "delusion". You're deluded to the extent that your model is misaligned with reality.

On the other hand, when you feel hunger and want food, and the top value truth is you could order food on an app to fulfill it, it clearly doesn't have a high enough value to fulfill your want because the truth lacks sufficient precision, and therefore lacks the value required to act on it and fulfill your want. Your model isn't powerful enough.

So, what happens next? Your mind works to make its model more powerful, by uncovering a truth with enough value to fulfill your want.

---

The mind uncovers truths by observing, understanding, and predicting.

To understand is to update values.

To predict is to guess.

---

Of course this is oversimplified. It's possible that when you're actively seeking truth to fulfill a want, another want comes and bombards you and commands immediate, full attention that pulls you away from your current want. Reality is messy. Nonetheless, I believe that understanding this simplified version of what actually happens preserves the essence of what's happening to make it useful (what does "useful" mean? Be more precise).

Delusion compounds.

(Show from the diagram above).

Seeking truth follows the power law. The best are orders of magnitude better than the average. And so much better than the worst that's it's not even comparable.

Let's say two people have the exact same want:
