## On seeking truth

To seek truth is to understand the reality of the world we live in so that we can get what we want from it.

Seeking truth has been the most important skill in human history that has led to the progress we’ve had a species. Soon, I believe, it will be the only skill that matters.

This essay is my attempt to understand what seeking truth actually means, what stops us from being good at it, and how its importance in our world will change as technological advancement accelerates.
### What is truth?

A truth is a reality of a system. A system is anything that has some phenomena happening inside of it. Physics, biology, chemistry, are all systems with varying events, characteristics and rules that govern them.

Because a truth is aligned with reality, it exists whether someone observes it, understands it, or even agrees with it. Gravity exists regardless of what anyone thinks about it.

For now, let’s think of a truth as a statement that’s represented by a sequence of English. A statement is true to the degree that it’s aligned with reality.

It’s possible for me to believe a statement is true, whereas in reality it’s not. Let’s call this gap, our “delusion”. Our delusion is the difference between what we think the truth is, and what the truth actually is.

And so seeking truth is the process of understanding a system as it exists in reality / reducing our delusion about a system.

The word “seek” means “try to find”. I think this describes the process of seeking truth well. Seeking truth is an iterative process that only gets you closer to the truth. We’ve yet to “find” the truth about any naturally occurring system, and from what we can tell, we understand very, very little of what is possible to understand. There is always more truth to be uncovered.

In other words, seeking truth is an iterative process that only gets you closer to understanding the truths of a system.

### Why seek truth?

**We want things, and we want to get what we want as quickly as possible.** _(This will be a fundamental driving point through the entire essay. The want and intensity of that want dictates almost everything in the truth seeking process)._

This is a fundamental truth about how the mind works for most, if not all, of us.

For us, time is the only resource that is scarce. And it’s not because we will die, but because we want to get what we want as quickly as possible. Even if we solve aging, time will continue to be a scarcity for us.

Seeking truth isn’t useful if you don’t want things and want to get what you want as quickly as possible. If you want something and don’t care when you’ll get it, and if you have infinite time, then you can simply try random things and you’ll eventually get what you want.

But if you care about getting what you want quickly, you’ll need to understand the systems that govern what you want so that you can exploit them to get what you want as quickly as possible.

Therefore, seeking truth gives you power to get what you want.

(note: even curiosity is a want: a want to understand something simply for the sake of understanding it. Even those that are curious would want to understand something as quickly as they can, and therefore seeking truth would be valuable to them as well.)

From a collective perspective: all resources that are currently scarce for humans (except time) exist in abundance in the universe: energy, the components that make water, light, etc.

And so, the only that prevents us from having an abundance in resources is our lack of understanding of the systems that govern these resources. And we gain that understanding by seeking truth.

From an individual or collective perspective, seeking truth is incredibly valuable. Our progress as a species is grounded in our ability to seek truth about the world we live in, and about ourselves.


### A truth has a notion of value.


### We each have a model for what we believe to be true

- Think of model as DB w/ rows with the fields:
	- Truth
	- Confidence
	- Value
- Truth is the statement that you believe in. Technically, unless this is perfectly aligned with reality, it is "what you believe to be true", not necessarily the truth.
- Confidence is how much you believe this truth to be true.
- Value is as defined above.
- Each row in this DB also corresponds with "delusion" (0 - 1.0) that corresponds with how aligned this truth, and value are with the objective reality.
- Power (model) = summing (value)(confidence)(1 - delusion). across all rows.
- Seeking truth is the process of optimizing for the power of your model. This is done by:
	- Increasing value.
	- Increasing confidence.
	- Decreasing delusion.
- Delusion lives outside of your model, i.e. outside of your head. If you could see what you're deluded about at this moment in time, then it's not a delusion for you as you know what it is.
	- (note: show an elegant image showing the model in a mind, and the delusion existing outside of that mind as the gap between the mind and reality).
- Delusion can only be understood in hindsight: after you've removed yourself of the delusion, you can better see how it existed in the past, and the nature of what it was (i.e. to what extent you were deluded about what things).
- Note: Increasing confidence seems straightforward - if it's in your own head, you can just make all your confidence high, for everything. But if you do this, you will drastically increase delusion - defeating your efforts.
- Note: the power of your model has nothing to do with whether you have proof or evidence to back up your model. If it's high value (objectively), you have high confidence, with minimal delusion, you have a powerful model.
	- *This might be better suited for when we start talking about the subconscious.*
	- E.g. Ramanujan pulling profound theories from "God" that all happened to be right. He didn't even get around to proving most before he died.
	- Those that simply have a feel for things, and that feel happens to be true. They may try to explain things after the fact, but that explanation is constructed, not what they actually used to have high skill.
- This is of course oversimplified, but it seems to be enough of an approximation for what's going on to enable a useful exploration and discussion. Here are where it may fall short:
	- Delusion ought to have a negative value as well, because some delusions don't just not add power, but actually remove power.
	- Here we've clubbed both kinds of delusions into a single value: i.e. the delusion 
### Our model is trained by observing, understanding, predicting

To **observe** is to "see" something happen.

To **understand** is to interpret what we've observed and update our inner model to reflect it.

For example, we could observe something that invalidates a truth we believe and so we update our inner model that negates the truth statement.

Or we observe something that reinforces a hunch that we have, and we increase the confidence for that truth.

Understanding is like a reaction to an observation, and can impact multiple truths in our model as part of the re-orienting of that inner model.

To **predict** is to extrapolate our understanding.

(Need to speak to the importance of prediction, and how without it the learning process is killed - i.e. takes much longer than required).

Some people say that these happen in a cycle, but I think it’s quite a messy process. Sometimes a prediction will lead to an experiment to enable the observation that tests the prediction, but just as often a prediction can be followed by a subconscious observation rising to the conscious mind out of seemingly nowhere, etc.

Which is why I think it’s safer to call to call an iteration any update to the model. It doesn’t matter what the order of the operations are, an update is an update if your model changes.

### It takes effort to seek truth, but effort itself is not truth seeking.

*(Two images, and later an animation: a cycle - kind of like the apple watch health cycle - with each segment corresponding to a component of truth seeking, or effort. As technology becomes more powerful, the segments corresponding to effort get smaller. Have a slider that corresponds to the power of technology, and show the cycle animating to less / more effort based on position of slider. The change is exponential, not linear, so one step increase in slider at later stages should have massive decrease in effort - actually see if the exponential is with time or technology).*

- Differentiate between seeking truth and the effort to seek truth using the visual.

You might have the question: even with a powerful model, if you can't act in the world according to it, or if the world isn't organized in a way that allows you to implement your model, then you're not really that powerful despite having a powerful model.

And you'd be right. There are ample evidences in history of great truth seekers in a variety of fields end up with truths that they can't act on because they weren't able to exert the effort required to do so, due to a lack of leverage: technology & / or people.

But, as we'll see later, this is becoming far less of an impediment. The world is rapidly evolving such that those with more powerful models will be more powerful because the friction to acting on them is rapidly falling.

This is actually more profound than I first thought. You ought not to be attached to the effort / pain it takes to seek truth. That itself is a hindrance. Just as the Buddha didn’t benefit from overly starving himself (by following the thought that hurting yourself is the path to truth).
### Everything changes, all at once, all the time.

- Every component of the process, including what you want, is constantly changing, all the time.
- Make the claim that this change is happening every moment whether you realize it or not.
- This is an incredibly important point. It will be a valuable reference in the next section where I dig into the mind.
- Wants evolve predictably.

### Seeking truth is a skill.

Firstly, what makes something a skill?
Why are the differences so pronounced?

The skill that matters is experiential, not intellectual.
You can't train this skill by simply reading a book or even listening to someone else's experiences.

What are the aspects of the skill?

- Accurately assessing the value of a truth. (i.e. correctly prioritizing).
- Maximizing the speed at which confidence is increased while minimizing delusion.
- Designing your wants to not limit your view. (this goes even further into designing your own identity to not limit your view).
- Knowing when to shift attention to reducing effort (speed up iteration), and when to shift back to the core truth seeking.
- Knowing when to stop generating predictions and go execute / knowing when to keep generating more predictions because there is a significantly better approach that is worth the wait.
- Keeping your want consistent, or understanding when you don’t really want something and switching to something you want as soon as possible.
  - You cannot truth seek effectively for wants you don’t really want. (This really needs to be expanded well - an important point).

### Is there luck?

(Reference: you are not a lottery ticket - I lean towards this as well, with a small caveat: it's healthy to delude yourself into believing there is minimal luck).

This is actually quite tough to understand. There seem to be too many factors at play. But I do think you can show how the factor of luck reduces the more iterations that take place.

This also goes into the nature vs. nurture debate: Even if you root out all the luck in the world, there’s still likely a factor of luck of birth: perhaps there are some who have different upper bounds in skill than others for reasons that we can’t yet see. It’s quite difficult to comprehensively make sense of this with our current understanding, but we can easily see the extreme cases: highly mentally challenged individuals will have difficulty in seeking truth effectively.

Of course, we don’t know if that disability can be reversed, it may not be as permanently crippling of a disability in the future, as we continue to seek truth about the nature of the human experience: mind and body.

### What stops us from seeking truth effectively?

- All the types of delusion
- Outcomes:
  - Local vs. global maxima. (this probably deserves its own section)
  - Too many wants.
  - Delusion. (talk about this towards the end as a segue to the next chapter).

### Seeking truth happens consciously and subconsciously.

(This should come after I explore what stops us from seeking truth effectively? Or rather, how can we get better at seeking truth? Because you can just look at each delusion).

This will require some time to explain, do this at a high level, will dig into it in detail in the next section.

The skill is experiential, not intellectual.

(Todo: there's a great example here with the fear that comes from burning your hand in fire, and how in the future even smelling something burning jolts you into caution, whereas the person who only understands it theoretically doesn't have a similar reaction).

## Self-delusion is the greatest impediment to seeking truth

(Title likely needs to be updated).

And this is the only difference between great truth seekers, and those who aren’t.

- Really dig into the conscious vs. subconscious models (this is actually the thinking model vs. the feeling model. It's just that most of feeling is subconscious so we don't realize what's happening).
- Sensitivity
- Mirror neurons: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22957393/.
- Conscious vs. subconscious models.

## Seeking truth is the only thing that remains

### How technology impacts seeking truth

- As technology becomes more powerful, you too will have more power to get what you want, if you understand how to seek truth effectively.

## Notes

### Training in truth seeking must be experiential. (Learn by doing).

- Every single thing in (“what exactly is the skill”) is achieved through the realm of feeling. You simply cannot have a hard and fast rule for it.
### Impact of exponential rise in technology:

(Following happen in tandem with power of technology:)

- Value of truth seeking will increase.
- Penalty of dogma will increase.
- Penalty of delusion will increase.

### Want does not imply imbalance of the mind.

- This is a common misconception that needs to be thoroughly debunked.

### Skill in seeking truth follows a power law.

(I might be able to shove this into the section on the impact of technology on truth seeking, and society at large). -> This is in act 3 (why seeking truth is the ONLY skill).

What is the right example to use to build this on?

- A person who wants to get across a body of water.

### Dogma penalty

The cost of dogmatic beliefs is rising exponentially in tandem with technology.

Historically, you could have a dogmatic belief and it may be true for a while before it was no longer true. As change happens exponentially faster, you can no longer believe in things that will be invalidated before you even get a chance to act on that belief.

All of the following are dogmatic beliefs:

- “Work less”, “work more”
- “Move fast”, “move slow”.

The skill is in knowing when to do what. That’s always been the case, and increasingly that will be the only viable option, you can’t risk blindly following a belief system without seeking the truth about it.

(Patrick Collison talks about minimizing the number of things a company innovates on, and how the organizational structure should be left as is - since the fundamental nature of the human being hasn’t changed that much - but perhaps even the organizational structure needs to be re-evaluated).

### Quotes

- “But in writing alone there is a danger that your interpretation of another human being will suffer from one-sidedness.” - Kurosawa (https://mysterymanonfilm.blogspot.com/2009/07/kurosawa-on-screenwriting.html)
- Conscious vs. subconscious wants: show how the subconscious wants are the ones that that impact the similarity function, value function. The gap b/w the conscious and the subconscious wants is where the problem starts. Part of self-delusion is not knowing the gap between these.
  - The greater the gap, multiplied by the intensities = tension.
- **The less delusion you have, the less choice you have.** Choice is a byproduct of delusion. Very easy to show why.
- As part of the “skill”, will need to derive all the qualities of a skilled truth seeker: intuition, judgement, taste, everything.

### Truths are clustered.
(This eventually needs to go into the part about subconscious induced myopia.)
Similarity function: a sense of similarity between truths.

To be clear, similarity and clustering also only make sense when we view it from the perspective of a person because of how we’ve defined it. It is subjective, and I think this way of looking at it makes sense given how there are many example of people who see connections between two truths that others don’t see.

Each of us likely has a different clusterings of truths because we have different “similarity functions”.

(With infinite time, we should, in theory, arrive at similar / the same / clusterings. Why is that? Because there is some sense of objectivity here even though it seems subjective (and this same point applies to the “value” above).
