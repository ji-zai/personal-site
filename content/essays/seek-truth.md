title: Seeking truth is the only skill

I started writing this essay to get a sense for what the most valuable skills will be in a future in which AI becomes incredibly powerful. As I spent more time exploring this question I realized that any valuable skill, at its core, is either a process of seeking the truth about the world we live in, or about ourselves. 

And I believe even that distinction (internal vs. external) is only intellectual. Our ability to seek truth about what we are directly impacts our ability to seek truth about the world we live in. After all, your mind is your lens into the world; you can't trust it fully without understanding it fully.

By "truth" I mean some property or rule we can observe about a system that exists in reality.

By "system", I mean anything that has some phenomena, or things happening in it. It doesn't matter whether you can observe those things or not. Before we had the microscope we couldn't observe the microscopic properties of biological systems, but those properties of course existed.

By "seeking truth", I mean the quest to understand the properties / rules of any system. 

I love the word "seek" because I think it perfectly encapsulates a fundamental truth about seeking truth: it is a process of iteration that can only better approximate the reality of a system, without ever reaching it. If you ever reach complete understanding of a system, you've "found" truth, which is clearly far from the case for most, if not all, systems we've encountered in nature.

What's the point of seeking truth? Well, if you have no wants, are perfectly content what what you have and what you understand about the world and yourself, there would be no point to seeking truth.

Two characteristics of our minds gives purpose to seeking truth: we want, and we want to get what we want as quick as possible.

The things we want are part of systems, and so, the more quickly we can seek truths about the systems that govern our wants, the more quickly we can get what we want.

Even curiosity is a want: wanting to understand a system with no other purpose than understanding it. But even those that are curious would prefer to understand a system more quickly if possible.

And so when you decide to become better at seeking truth, all it means is that you want to seek truth faster than you can right now. (note: time is our only scarcity not because we will die, but because of the second characteristic of the mind: wanting what we want as quick as possible).

But, more often than not, the purpose of seeking truth is to gain power over a system, so that we can get what we want from it, as quickly as we can. 

So clearly seeking truth is valuable. But is it a skill?

Something is a skill when there's some notion of "goodness" to it: i.e. one way of doing it is better than another. And in the case of seeking truth, "well" is simply how quickly you can seek truths about a system.

To make talking about seeking truth easier, let's define "delusion" as the exact opposite of a "truth". "Uncovering a truth" about a system == "Reducing delusion" about a system such that the degree of delusion reduced is proportional to how much the truth tells us about the system.

(Show this to be true with a simple, contrived example of a system and two strategies).

But, of course this example was a contrived system to illustrate that there is skill to seeking truth. In nature, systems are incredibly messy. Not knowing the output for an input is simply one of the many kinds of delusions we can have about a system.

Understanding all the ways we can be deluded about a system helps us have a more granular, higher resolution, more true understanding of what seeking truth even means.

Our delusions about a system often manifest through:
- Inaccuracies in how we represent truths. (We often use formal language such as English, math, code, etc. and they are inherently only approximations of the truth - and often severely lacking approximations).
- Observation inaccuracies in the tools we use to observe a system.
- Overly limiting (or isolated) view of a system.
- Inaccuracies in what you think you already know, and / or the degree of confidence you have in uncovered truths.

Anyone looking to seek truth ought to take these (and many more) inaccuracies and incorrect assumptions into account when seeking truth.

But, in my own experience, and based on what I've seen in the world, I believe the deadliest cause for our delusion about the systems we study is our **self-delusion**: our lack of understanding in the way our minds work and the ways in which our minds cloud our view of reality.

I believe this is the biggest reason why we fail to see some of the most obvious, profound truths - which are often right under our noses.

This is why when someone makes a profound discovery, to many it seems stupidly obvious in hindsight. It's not that the truth was kept hidden and required great difficulty to excavate it, but that most of our minds were too clouded to see it, even if we were trying to find it. Especially if we're trying to find it.

You can have the most accurate tools, more accurate references, most accurate account of what you already know, but if you fail to see reality as it is, then the most fundamental tool you use to understand the world outside is polluted. You can't rely on it.

What exactly are we deluded about regarding ourselves that leads us to be deluded about the systems we study? What causes it? Is there any way to overcome it - to reduce our self-delusions?

To add (potentially):
- And we're terrible at keeping our self-delusions locked up in ourselves. When we meet others we inadvertently, often subconsciously, try to get them to be self-deluded in the same ways we are.
- Meanwhile, the limit for how much power we can gain in the system is limited only by the degree to which there is order in the system. If everything happens randomly, all the time, 
- Even if you don't believe it's the only skill, but see that it's important you'll want to get better at it.
- Seeking truth turns from a passion to being useful based on how badly you want something. Fundamentally,
- Reducing our delusion about a system also reduces our degrees of choice in the system. In the most extreme case, if you perfectly understand a system, the only thing you can change is what you want out of that system. You'll know what is possible and what is impossible, and you'll be forced to change your want to something you know is possible to even get (or you're insane).
- Meanwhile, the limit for how much power we can gain in the system is limited only by the degree to which there is order in the system. If everything happens randomly, all the time, 

Cut:
- , because any unnoticed biases in our minds makes it more difficult for us to see reality as it is in our external worlds.

The value of seeking truth is grounded in the intensity of your wants. It's only when you want something out of a system that seeking the truth about it becomes valuable as it gives you greater power to get what you want out of that system.

That want could even be as simple as wanting to understand the system with no other purpose.

The nature of the human mind is to want, and to get what it wants as quickly as possible. And as a result of the second characteristic, time is our only scarcity. (note: Time is not scarce because we will not exist someday, but a consequence of this characteristic of our mind. Therefore even if we somehow solve aging, time will still be scarce.).

There is nothing else that we can say is "scarce" because, technically, we can see abundance in every other thing we care about: material resources, energy, etc. We just don't know how to extract things we value efficiently from those abundant resources. And we can learn how to do that by seeking truths about the systems that govern those resources.

So, only when you want something from a system will you want to seek the truths about it. And how intensely you want those wants will influence how intensely you want to know the truths about it.
