### What is truth?

A truth is a reality of a system. A system is anything that has some phenomena happening inside of it. Physics, biology, chemistry, are all systems with varying events, characteristics and rules that govern them.

Because a truth is aligned with reality, it exists whether someone observes it, understands it, or even agrees with it. Gravity exists regardless of what anyone thinks about it.

For now, let’s think of a truth as a statement that’s represented by a sequence of English characters. A statement is true to the degree that it’s aligned with reality.

The word “seek” means “try to find”. This describes the process well: seeking truth is a search problem. As you search and uncover more truths, you only get closer to the complete truth. We’ve yet to “find” the truth about any naturally occurring system, and from what we can tell, we understand very, very little of what is possible to understand. There is always more truth to be uncovered, and we will likely be perpetually seeking.

### Why seek truth?

Seeking truth only matters in the context of wanting something. If you don't want anything, then what's the point of seeking truth about anything? There is no such thing as understanding something for the sake of it, because even that curiosity is just a want: a want to understand the nature of something.

Skill in seeking truth is the same thing as skill in getting what you want. Therefore, if you're a human being that wants, then you'd benefit from learning how to seek truth more effectively, to the extent that it's possible to do so.

Therefore, skill in seeking truth lies at the foundation of any skill that we value, because any skill exists only if it enables you fulfill a certain kind of want. Skill in seeking truth lies at the core of skill in building a great company (a want to make a product people want, skill making great art (a want to express yourself).

You might wonder that such a general definition makes it useless. Of course when defined this way seeking truth is the only skill. But the generality is precisely where the value of studying this lies. 

If seeking truth is the most fundamental skill, then studying it should tell us more about the nature of learning, how to improve our ability to learn, to understand. It will show us which aspects of this skill are generalizable to any skill, and which are specific to what you're doing.

Using "Seeking truth" to define such a fundamental skill is useful because it's opinionated in a way that sheds more light on the nature of the process. "Seeking" implies that it is a search problem. And "truth" implies that there is some objectivity to it - that there is in fact a notion of "better" for any skill, that it's not entirely subjective.

And therefore, using this phrase to describe the most fundamental skill is far more useful than using something like "learning", "growing", etc. which don't offer such a glimpse into what it means.

So, where do we start? There's only one place: how the mind works to help you get what you want. We need some model of the mind in order to explore seeking truth because that is where the mechanism for any skill exists.

Anyone talking about any skill, whether they realize it or not, has an implicit assumption about the way the mind works that they base their reasoning on. For example, in today's mainstream culture, phrases like "learn by doing", "the more you do, the better you get", or "you need to be resilient to do great work" are commonly used to describe how to get better at skills.

While I believe these advices are directionally correct, they can be dangerous when followed blindly.

For example, someone blindly following "resilience is required" may not choose to quit a path even though that's objectively the right thing to do to enable them to succeed. Someone who blindly follows "learn by doing", may not carve out the optimal time to study how to do it from those that are great.

And when we follow "the more you put out, the better you get", we assume that rate of output is the most important way to measure learning all of the time. And yet 

Dogmatic understanding of what it means to seek truth will lead us astray, if not now, then eventually.

Then there's the catch all term "judgement": knowing when to do what. We're advised to have better judgement so that we don't fall into the traps of dogmatically following approaches. Of course, this would be incredibly useful to train, but what does this mean and how do you get better at it? Is the only way to keep doing? Or are there other techniques we can use to improve this?

And then there's the "you can only answer these questions by doing". Once again, I think this advice is correct directionally, but creates the dangerous impression that there is nothing else that can be done to improve your rate of learning.

Therefore, to understand how true these pieces of advice are, and to see if there are any ways to get better at getting better itself, we have no choice but to study seeking truth with enough nuance and detail to hopefully help us form some useful opinions about the nature of learning itself.

Where do we start?

The only place we can start is by understanding how the mind works.

All of the mainstream wisdom implicitly assumes a theory of mind, whether it's acknowledged or not. "Resilience" is only required if the mind struggles when learning. "Doing is the best way to learn" implies that when the mind intellectualizes a skill, it's not enough to be good at it. We need to try and understand why these things happen.

When we have a more nuanced, precise theory of how the mind works, we should be able to derive and define all of the commonly used terms related to seeking truth.

### The mind has an internal model of what it believes is true, and this model determines how we act to get what we want.

When you want something, if you know exactly what to do to get it, and you're able to, then in order to fulfill that want, you can just act on what you know and get it. 

When you want something and don't perfectly know what you need to do to get it, you have no choice but to seek truth about the systems that govern what you want, so that you understand what you need to do to get what you want.
*(todo: need to potentially move the nature of want someplace else, or change how I start this section).*

We act according to our model in order to get the things that we want.

For now, let's think of this model as a spreadsheet with many rows, each corresponding to a truth you believe in.

Each row would have the following columns:
1. Your truth (a statement).
2. Confidence (how much you believe that your truth is actually aligned with reality).
3. Value (how much you value this truth).

The "value" field of each row depends on what you want in that moment. And of course, you only value a truth if it helps you fulfill what you want in that moment. Which means that each time our want changes, the values in our model are updated to reflect our value for the new want.

You might ask what happens when we want multiple things at once. I believe the mind focuses on one want at a time, and the feeling that we can multi-task probably exists because we're not aware of the jumps between wants that the mind is always making - sometimes within a single second.

(side note:
An interesting example is what I experienced just now: I was typing a word in the above paragraph, felt some hunger, wanted some food - all while not stopping the typing. And then my mind noticed a spelling mistake in my typing and my current want shifted to wanting to to fix it, leading me to hit backspaces and re-type.

Even in this small window of typing a word, my stomach growled, my mind wanted food, and then saw that I made a typo and then jumped back to wanting to fix it. I don't think those wants happened simultaneously, but because of the short duration in which it happened, it may seem so. But if they didn't happen simultaneously, how did my fingers keep typing while I was wanting something else other than to write the next word? I think because we can do things mindlessly without actively wanting, just how we can drive a car without wanting to.

The presence of mindless action that is fulfilling a previous want doesn't disprove that the mind can only want one thing at a time.
)

But even if you believe otherwise (that there are multiple "threads" so to speak), understanding how a single thread operates should at least be directionally illuminating.

### What happens when we want something?

Either we have the muscle memory to fulfill it right away 

The mind recollects the highest value truth for this want that it has. But clearly this truth doesn't always suffice in helping you get what you want, so there has to be some notion of a "requirement" for a want, such that if your highest valued truth for a given want doesn't meet the requirement for your want, you have to uncover more truths until you have one with a high enough value to fulfill your want.

(And to be clear, your model could be wrong. Even if you have a truth with sufficient value, acting on it still might not result in fulfilling what you want. Let's call this gap between your model and reality "delusion". You're deluded to the extent that your model is misaligned with reality. We'll see later all the ways your model can be deluded, but for now, it's clear that delusion reduces the power of your model because the greater the delusion, the less likely your model is enables you get what you want.)

### The mind uncovers truths by observing, understanding, and predicting.

To observe is to perceive something happening. You can perceive this through any of your senses: see, hear, taste, feel, smell, or thinking (i.e. observing a thought). 

Think of this step as adding a row to your model: when you observe, say, a tree floating down a river for the first time, a row with the truth "tree floats on river" is added to your model.

As soon as the mind observes something, it tries to understand it.

To understand is to assign a value to a truth in your model. But, as we discussed, the value depends on a want, so your mind values the truth according to what you want in that moment. 

If, in that moment, you want to eat something, then this truth you observed is valued quite low.

Understanding also happens whenever your want changes.

In this situation, if your want changes from wanting to eat something to wanting to find a way across the river, then your mind re-values the previous observation of the tree floating quite highly, because it believes it will help fulfill your want.

To predict is to guess other truths based on the ones already in your model. The mind tries to predict the truths that will help you get what you want in that moment.

A prediction is nothing but another row in your model, often with less confidence than the truths that you've derived directly from an observation. This makes sense as a guess wouldn't be a guess if you already had high confidence in it.

When a prediction adds a truth to the model, the mind understands is (i.e. assigns it a value).

Each step in this cycle is a reaction. An understanding is a reaction to an observation or prediction. A prediction is a reaction to an understanding.

But where does an observation come from? I don't believe it comes from a void and that it's a direct reaction to a want.

When you want something, the mind is primed to observe things that it believes will help fulfill your want. 

Through all the senses, we consume a great deal of information, yet only a small fraction of that information rises to our conscious mind in a way that we can observe. What we want influences what reaches our conscious mind. And how intensely we want influences what our mind observes: the more intense, the more observations will be ones that your mind believes are more directly related to fulfilling your want. (note: easy to show this with example: tiger chasing you).

A want gives energy to this cycle. When the want dies down (either when it's fulfilled, or when it gets weaker on its own) this cycle no longer has the energy to keep going. (probably want to keep this later).

Eventually the mind finds a truth with sufficient value that could fulfill your current want.

When this happens, your mind wants to act on this top truth to get what you want.

(Transition, need to put somewhere appropriate)

So far, it may seem that how you value a truth and how you predict a truth is purely subjective. After all, it's just what your mind believes. But in reality, there is an objectivity to how you value and predict. That can only be the case, otherwise no one would be bad at seeking truth, meaning no one would struggle to get what they want.

### How does the mind value a truth?

From nature's perspective, things just exist, and value is a feature of a being that wants something. If you have no wants, there's no sense to value one truth over another.

How you value a truth depends on what you want. The value corresponds to how much you believe that truth will enable you to get what you want.

Therefore, you'd value one truth more than another if it gets you more of what you want, more quickly.

Predictive power and relevance determine a truth's value.

Predictive power is how much that truth tells about the systems that govern your want, in a way that enables you to act on it.

There are two aspects to this predictive power: fundamentality, and precision.

For someone building a bridge, the truth about the formula for gravity is far more valuable than the truth: "when you throw something up, it will fall back down".

From the perspective of this engineer, both are true, but the formula for gravity tells them a lot more about the system they're operating in. They're able to predict how the system will behave without having to see that behavior.

They can tell a lot more because they can derive a variety of behaviors from the formula for gravity. A truth is more fundamental the more things that can be derived from it.

The know what forces will act on the bridge and can therefore plan for it without having to go through the process of building something that doesn't work, having it break, and then learning from it. This is invaluable.

For a truth to have power, it also needs to be precise. Precision is having enough detail to be actionable.

For example: "Ai is going to greatly change the world" is far weaker of a truth than knowing exactly how it will impact the world, in which ways. The person that believes the former may lead the person to learn more about AI, and perhaps make a few good long term investments. A person that knows the latter will be able to help build the future of AI.

In a way, precision is required for a truth to be fundamental as well. An overly generic truth can't be used to derive anything from it. So these are different ways of describing what at the end of the day is simply predictive power.

Yet, a powerful truth is useless to someone if it doesn't help them get what they want, i.e. it's not relevant to them.

For a person in a village who desperately needs to build a boat to get across a large body of water, e = mc^2 isn't valuable at all, even though it is an incredibly powerful truth that tells a lot about the world we live in.

Therefore, relevancy is critical for a person to value a truth.

Another way to look at it is:
- Relevancy is how aligned it is with your want.
- Power is the magnitude of the truth.

It may seem that the way a person values a truth is purely subjective, and changes from person to person. That is mostly true, but there is objectivity to this as well.

Two people with the same want, with sufficient time to seek truth about the systems that govern their want, will eventually converge towards the same values for truths pertaining to those systems.

For example, world leaders who want to keep their countries safe would all value greatly the truths about how nuclear weapons operate.

Therefore, from here on out, I'll refer to the "true value" of a truth for a given want to be the value that someone who has the want, and a complete understanding of all the systems that govern that want, would assign to this truth.

It's easy to see how the "true value" often differs from the value we associate with a truth.

For example (show an example of someone who discovers something for the first time thinks it's a game changing breakthrough, that is stupidly valuable, but it's only after you discover something more powerful that you learn to put the previously highly valued truth in its place. Or even better: what seems like an unnecessary truth today, may actually be an incredibly valuable once sufficient understanding ripens in adjacent systems).

And we've found in practice that the values of truths follow the power law: the most valuable truths are orders of magnitudes more valuable than the least valuable ones. (note: may need to substantiate this a bit more).

### How does your mind predict truths from what it already knows?

It does this by having a notion of similarity between two truths.

For a person who wants to get across a lake, the truths: "wood floats on water", and "a sail can propel with wind", are far more similar than the truth "gold sinks in water" is with either of them.

Why is that? Because a person who wants to get across a body of water is probably not going to predict something about the floating nature of gold in water, as it's so unrelated to what they want. Similarly, they wouldn't predict the kind of insects that live in the wood after they understand "wood floats on water".

In other words, the similarity between two truths is the likelihood of you predicting one as a reaction to the understanding of the other.

Similarity doesn't seem to fully depend on the value the truths. You won't always predict truths that are valuable, and more often than not you'll predict a bunch of truths that are useless before you start to predict more useful ones. 

So similarity(t1, t2) and value(t) seem to be independent functions.

Similarity also impacts what you observe, because an observation can be a reaction to a prediction, and so if the similarity function determines prediction, it will impact observation since you'll only create experiments for what you predict. (note: what about the observation that is a direction reaction to a want and not a prediction?)

This similarity function creates "clusters" of truths. Therefore, as you seek truth, you'll tend to understand it in clusters.

Over time, as you understand more of the systems that govern your want, you'll realize that some clusters are much closer than you initially thought they were. (todo: show a good example for this).

Similar to the value function, there is a sense of objectivity to the similarity function, or in other words there's a "true similarity" between two truths, for a given want.

Two individuals with the same want, given infinite time to seek truth, will eventually converge on the same similarity function.

They'd have no choice but to see the similarity between two truths that initially seemed far apart if those two truths work together to help them get what they want.

For example, most people thought that the truths about rubber and metal were two "far apart" clusters of truths until we invented tools and materials that utilized both (like car tires). 

Then, they became more similar truths. When someone thinks about how to use rubber to get what they want, they're now more likely to think about the truths about metals as a way to reinforce the rubber in more useful ways. (todo: there's definitely a better example, but this conveys the gist of what I'm trying to get at).
