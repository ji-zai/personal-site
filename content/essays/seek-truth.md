The ability to seek truth is the most valuable skill for a founder.

Any human creation we value is based on some truth(s) about the world, or mind. You need to be able to seek truth in order to do great work.

As AI improves exponentially fast, the value of truth seeking rises in tandem. Fortunately, it's a skill that can be trained.

## You’re deluded

To understand truth seeking, you need to understand what truth is. And to understand truth, you need to understand what delusion is.

If you take any system, your delusion is not knowing how it works. The degree of delusion is the degree to which you don't understand how it works.

If you were not deluded, you would make absolutely no mistakes. So clearly we're all deluded to some extent about most, if not all, systems that exist in the universe.

We reduce our delusion about a system by uncovering truths about it.
The statements: "uncovering a truth" is the exact equivalent to "reducing delusion". We reduce delusion to the extent that the uncovered truth shows us the reality of the system.

The entire truth often doesn't present itself all at once, but rather in chunks. We uncover truths about a system by exploring that system.

Of course, not all exploration is of the same quality. Randomly exploring a system and not taking note of what you already know, what you might not know and not planning anything leads to wasted time and effort.

And so, as humanity evolved, we improved our ability to plan our exploration.

For any system, we start with some model of what we think the reality of that system is, what truths we already know about the system (through previous exploration), to what degree our confidence is about each truth we already know (because not all discoveries from explorations are certain), and based on this information, we plan ways to explore the system to improve our understanding of its reality.

When we come across a truth that disagrees with our model of the system, we methodically work through how to update our model to more accurately represent reality. This often involves a combination questioning our confidence in previous truths, questioning how we interpreted the results of previous explorations, and even questioning the boundary we set for the system: perhaps the system is larger, more encompassing, than we had originally thought.

This became our chosen method to better understand the world we live in.

And by definition, following this process is the absolute best we can do to understand any system, because doing anything otherwise would be introducing unnecessary randomness into the process.

And best here means understanding it the most quickly we can possibly hope to understand it.

To be clear, we're still following the optimal path if we choose a random area to explore IF our current model of the system has dark areas that we believe to be all equally potentially valuable to explore.

Choosing a random area to explore by itself doesn't pollute our method, but rather adding randomness to our planning for how we choose is what pollutes the method.

Now, you might say that it may not be the fastest way to explore the system by giving the example of two individuals exploring the same system without having any information from the other person. By following the most optimal strategy, one person might understand the entire system faster than the other.

How can that be?

Because not all truths are created equal.

So, if at any point in an understanding of a model there are equally valued unknown areas to explore, unless in reality they both reveal an equal magnitude of truth, there is guaranteed to be a factor of "luck" that is beyond our control in how quickly we can understand a system.

Based on what we've seen in the world, we know for a fact that not all truths we discover are of equal magnitude. And in fact, they follow the power law: the "top" truths have uncovered orders of magnitudes more about our world than the "lowest" truths.

And we have no reason to believe that this isn't the case for all systems that can be explored.

Therefore, let's take this power law of truth quality to be a truth - with a high confidence (which for all practical purposes is full confidence).

Therefore, we know that there's a factor of luck in how quickly we can explore any system, that is completely out of our control.

(Connect this to internal system by using the recent Google story).

Your conscious mind and subconscious mind are in opposition with each other. They want different things for you.

By definition, what happens in the conscious mind are all the things that you can perceive such as the thoughts you think, strong emotions, etc. and of course, what happens in the subconscious is invisible to the conscious mind.

For most of us, what our conscious mind wants are the usual things: i.e. to do good for the world, peace and harmony, etc.

But all our subconscious mind cares about is self-preservation, and in our modern world, this manifests as a craving for external validation and status. It’s hardwired deep into our psyche as part of evolution.

Your conscious mind needs internal consistency to have self-respect and feel like it’s sane. Your subconscious knows this, which is why it needs to hide its cravings from your conscious mind. It warps your perception of reality to make your conscious mind believe you’re putting the team above you, while deep down in the subconscious layers, you’re actually optimizing for getting your face on the cover of Forbes.

Your conscious mind is deluded by your subconscious mind (i.e. you’re deluding yourself all the time).

It’s quite easy to spot this contradiction and delusion in others because their subconscious mind can’t warp your perception, so you can see how they’re enslaved by their subconscious. They say they want to do one thing, but you can see that their actions directly contradict the desires they’ve voiced.

(TODO: Give examples of this happening in the context of a startup!)

But you’re just as inconsistent, delusional and enslaved by your subconscious as you see others to be, if not worse. It’s just a lot more difficult to see your own delusions because of how effective your subconscious is at warping your perception.

When you get a glimpse of what’s happening in your subconscious, you’ll puke. It’ll be disgusting. Atrocious. You’re not what you think you are. And you’re definitely not what you tell the world you are.

While your conscious mind dreams of fixing education, your subconscious dreams of adding “forbes_x_under_x”, or “some_status_symbol” in your Twitter bio.

While your conscious mind dreams of building tools that empower the billions around the world, your subconscious dreams of being on Lex’s podcast chatting about how you changed the world.

The more you dig, the more crap comes up. Keep a bucket close by.

**You are everything you hate in others, 10x’ed.**

## Self-delusion causes failure

All of your mistakes and failures stem from how deluded your conscious mind is about what’s actually happening in your subconscious.

You might be wondering why I’ve been so fixated on the internal reality of your own mind rather reality of the external world. After all, for your startup to succeed, you’ll need to build a product that is aligned with the reality of the external world you’re operating in.

Our delusions about the external world stem from our internal delusions.

Reduce internal delusion and you’ll find you’re able to see the external world more clearly.

All of the most profound truths are sitting right under your nose. You just have to learn to see them, and your delusion prevents you from seeing them.

Think about all the great companies you care about... there is a single, simple truth that each is constructed around. These truths are so simple. Which is why all great products seem stupidly obvious in hindsight.

You intuitively knew about the truths they were built on, but they never entered your conscious mind. Or even if they did, you might not have given them the importance they deserved due to your biases.

Your subconscious prevents you from seeing solutions that it believes will be too painful for you. After all, that’s its job: self-preservation.

Therefore when faced with a situation, if you’re not careful, your subconscious mind will make a decision for you by choosing the least painful option.

You either won’t even know that you made the decision, or if it’s a decision you have to actively communicate to others about, then you’ll “feel” this subconscious pull towards a particular decision and then your conscious mind will come up with some plausible sounding narrative to maintain its internal consistency.

For example, for someone with a fear of, say, large social gatherings, will find that their lives unfold in a way that conveniently avoids large social gatherings without the thought “I’m avoiding large social gatherings because of my social fear” even arising in their mind.

This is why when you ask an engineer who spent 3 months building a feature whether we should cut it since it doesn’t fit with the new product roadmap, they’re very likely to try and justify keeping the feature because it’s incredibly painful to throw away hard work like that.

This is an example of how the subconscious makes the decision for you, but the conscious mind comes up with a plausible narrative and it appears to you that you’ve made the decision even though it was made for you by your subconscious long before a thought even arose in your conscious mind.

This is why products, codebases, design systems, documentation, etc. get bloated and grow in complexity over time. It’s more painful to cut than it is to add. It’s more painful to take a step back without attachment and revisit how to do things from first principles than it is to just slap on the next thing.

Your delusion impacts not just smaller decisions about adding features, etc, but every single thing you do.

One of the biggest decisions you’ll make in life is choosing what to work on. Most people have a massive blindness towards most possibilities for how to spend your time. Especially the most extreme ones which also happen to be the most interesting.

Your subconscious will literally prevent you from seeing possibilities that it perceives are too difficult, too painful. It will make decisions for you such that your life will unfold without the thought of such possibilities even entering your mind.

The ideas your conscious mind thinks are ambitious are nothing in comparison to the truly ambitious paths that are possible, that you simply cannot see.

So, not only does your delusion prevent you from executing your startup well, it prevents you from even seeing the best ideas to pursue that, by their nature of being the best, are likely to be the most painful.

Delusion also causes great stress as a result of the internal friction between your conscious and subconscious minds.

The way I’ve presented the conscious and subconscious minds as completely separate entities is a lie. They’re tightly coupled.

When the subconscious makes decisions on your behalf, you will act on those decisions. And when you do, there’s some part of you that feels the contradiction between your conscious and subconscious, which expresses as stress in the form of guilt, anxiety, etc.

We all know the feeling of consciously deciding to stick to a diet and somehow find ourselves biting down on a cake our friend brought over, only to feel guilty afterwards for not sticking to what we planned to do.

This same drama plays out for almost every micro decision you make about anything.

<WithAnnotation
    line="When you say you’re making a decision that’s best for the team when in reality it’s because of your subconscious craving for status, even if you’re not consciously aware of that contradiction, you will still experience the stress of that contradiction."
    markdown="When a contradiction between the conscious and subconscious mind itself is stressful, just imagine how stressful contradiction in the conscious mind itself can be! <p> High integrity people tend to be less stressed than low integrity people because they don’t add an additional stress on top of all the existing ones. <p> It’s also cool that “integrity” translates to both being honest and is also the quality of being whole or complete. When the conscious understands the subconscious, the mind becomes more whole and you’ll be forced to be more honest because you see the pain that comes from dishonesty." />

Self-delusion adds so much stress without you even realizing it. An unnecessary burden on top of all the usual burdens of starting a company.

## Seeking truth is the only antidote

Seeking truth is the process of seeing, understanding and accepting what’s happening in the subconscious layers of your mind.

It’s like shining a light into your subconscious, bringing some of its activity into your conscious visibility.

You might have noticed that in this definition of seeking truth, there’s nothing about actually changing anything. So, how does seeking truth actually remove delusion?

The crazy thing is, change happens on its own.

The beauty of this process is that when you shed light on your subconscious and brought some of it into your conscious visibility, you’ve created an inconsistency in your conscious mind: you thought you were one thing, but the reality you saw in your subconscious has completely shattered that view.

Your mind HATES internal inconsistencies. In a panic it will try to bridge the gap between what your conscious mind wants to be, and what you actually are.

<WithAnnotation
  line="This is when your ego helps you."
  markdown="This is why I’m not a fan team cultures that emphasize “low egos”. I often find these teams full of people that simply don’t care. It’s easy to agree with someone, or let your ideas be discarded when you don’t give a shit about the product. <p>Big ego to achieve something worthwhile + truth seeking => they do great work by making their egos work for what their conscious mind wants.<p>If this weren't the case, successful founders would all be saints, which is far from truth. <p>Dream big. Believe that YOU will change the world for the better. And then keep that ego soaked in the truth." />

To bridge the inconsistency, your mind can either:

1. Become dejected by realizing that you’re not all that you thought you were and give up pursuing your dreams.
2. Or, your mind will force you to rise to become the person you want to be, that you earlier thought you were, but have since realized you are not.

The ego pushes you to take the second path. It pushes you to rise to your ideal self-image.

When equipped with truth, your ego becomes an ally.

The evolution takes time. As you keep seeing the contradiction and feeling the pain it causes you, your can’t help but slowly bridge the gap. It’s like you keep burning your hand on a hot pan for some reason, and you can clearly see it. Over time you’ll eventually stop burning your hand even if there’s a strong pull to touch the pan (for whatever reason). Self-delusion means you can’t see the burning. When you see it, the self-preservation mechanism of your mind will work to minimize the pain of the contradiction.

This doesn’t mean that your subconscious mind will stop optimizing for self-preservation.

When you have better visibility into your subconscious activities, and you’re making a decision, you’ll be able to see that the subconscious wants it for a reason you don’t support, you can take a step back and more carefully evaluate whether that is the right decision because you can sense that your subconscious is craving it. And anything your subconscious craves should worry you because it stems from that source of self-preservation, which is likely at odds with what your conscious mind is optimizing for in that moment.

And by slowly increasing the visibility you have into what’s actually determining your decisions, you’ll act on those subconscious cravings less, and will be able to make better decisions.

## How to train truth seeking

Truth seeking is a skill that can be trained.

Everyone is unique, so the specific techniques and paths that work best for an individual may not work for another. Yet, I believe there are some common features for truth seeking technique.

Some of it may sound like “mindfulness” or “meditation”, but those words are so loaded that I ask you try and throw away any notion you have about them. There’s nothing going on except you trying to understand what’s happening in your own mind. Let’s leave it at that without trying to label it.

TODO:

- You of course already know what the mind needs to do, but intellectually understanding what you want it to do has nothing to do with actually being able to do it. That's because thinking thoughts is an entirely different muscle than observing. Therefore we need to train that muscle of observing.
-

### 1) Truth seeking requires acceptance of delusion

Or at least, accept the possibility that you’re deluded. Because the concept of “seeking truth” makes no sense if you’re not deluded, because that means you already see the truth clearly.

By accepting delusion, you’ve already planted the seed in your conscious mind to be more wary of what you “feel” like doing because there’s clearly a part of you that doesn’t want what you want.

You’ll question your instincts more. This doesn’t mean you won’t do what you instinctively want to do, but you will have more space to actively make the decision rather than let your subconscious make it for you without your say.

### 2) Truth seeking happens through nonjudgemental observation.

I don’t believe truth seeking can happen in its fullest form while you’re actively consuming information from the world outside. Watching a video, listening to a podcast, or anything that requires your conscious mind to be actively engaged hampers its ability to observe itself.

What this looks like in practice is to turn your attention inwards and observe whatever you see / feel / think without judging anything.

The muscle to observe objectively without judgement is a totally different muscle that is used for actively thinking thoughts. And the objective observation muscle is the one that allows you to see what’s happening without getting caught up in it.

When you actively think thoughts, you’re caught up in the game of the mind. You have to train the mind to take a step back and just check out what’s happening, without even asking why.

You need to watch what’s happening in the same way you can watch people at a party without actively participating in any single discussion. Conversations all around you, people dancing, jumping, loud music, whatever. You’re just taking it all in while doing nothing.

That’s the key. “Doing nothing”. But the muscle to “do nothing” is so underdeveloped that you’ll find doing nothing is fucking tough. But the muscle exists because like any other muscle, the more you do, the better you get.

You have a thought, you recognize the thought is there, and you notice the thought leaving without actively engaging with it. You don’t ask why. You don’t regret having the thought. You don’t try and actively push the thought away because you’re ashamed of it. You have to see it and accept it.

You will of course have the tendency to start engaging with the thought when you observe it, because that’s what you’ve been doing with your conscious mind your entire life. That habit is tough to break.

When your mind inevitably starts engaging with a thought by going down its rabbit hole, gently, without judging yourself or going “oh shit” or having any sort of negative reaction to it, bring it back to just checking out what’s going on. Just observing.

If you struggle to bring yourself back to observing without judging yourself. Say you have an “oh shit I need to get back” reaction, don’t have another one for that reaction.

The mind is like quicksand, it has a tendency to go down vicious cycles. Once the chain reaction starts it can go further than you’d think.

“Oh shit I need to bring my mind back”

“Oh shit, I did it again. Damn.”

“Shit, I think I suck at this. How am I so damn bad at this?”

“I was so reckless today and shipped a bug into production and now I can’t just sit and observe. Why can’t I do anything right?”

“Like, do I even deserve to have the opportunity to build a company?”

“Such utter incompetence”.

“Oh shit, I need to bring my mind back”

You need to find a way to cut that vicious cycle as early as you can. You’ll get better at this as you train the observation muscle.

You could do this in many scenarios. While you go on a walk. You could sit with eyes closed. On a train looking out. Wherever. But the key is to not let the mind grasp onto details in the external world.

This is why I tend to choose the sitting and closing eyes option when I can to remove the visual distractions of the world, but it’s also possible to do this with eyes open, just more difficult because there will be more distractions to pull yourself back from.

It’s valuable to practice this in multiple scenarios - eyes open sometimes and eyes closed - because you never know when you’ll find yourself in a position in which you can’t keep your eyes closed (e.g. in a boring lecture in which you don’t want to come off as sleepy).

### 3) Truth seeking takes time. A lot of time. Like… a lot.

And I don’t mean a lot of time as in a lifetime’s work or some something vague. I literally mean you’ll need have to have a long continuous block of time.

To get even a glimpse into 0.000001% of what’s happening in your subconscious, you’ll need to patiently sit and observe for hours. But that little sliver of truth can be incredibly powerful.

I urge you to avoid any tools that present themselves as shortcuts “just 5 mins a day will change your life”. I know, they sound tempting, but they’ll hold you back from truly exploring what’s going on inside. And if you’re with me until now, I hope you at least acknowledge that most of your problems stem from this thing called your mind and that it’s worth trying to get to know what the hell’s happening inside of it.

The value of seeking truth increases exponentially with time (i.e. one hour is not just 12 times more effective than 5 minutes, but an order of magnitude more effective. Why? I think it’s because our subconscious activities are powered by our chemical biological systems (hormone secretion) which doesn’t follow a linear scale).

So if you already have some kind of truth seeking activity you do, I urge you to at least occasionally try longer durations.

### 4) Truth seeking is difficult.

Embrace the fact that understanding what’s going on in your mind will be one of most challenging things you’ll do.

If something starts to feel easy for some reason, be cautious. It could be a trap, a trick to get you to think that you’re done and got all you need from the session.

The most uncomfortable, painful, profound truths often come after the “highs” when you feel like everything’s good. You need to give them time to rise.

<WithAnnotation
line='This is why I suggest using a timer. Set the time you want and don’t get up even if you feel good and "done".'
markdown="Of course, there's on need to push yourself too hard and hurt yourself. If you need to stop, stop."
/>

After that phase when you feel the world is perfect for that moment, some worry, anxiety, or heck, your back pain will kick in. Great! The productive work starts again. Look forward to the difficulties, you’re bound to have them.

- Try your best to be at ease physically. When your body is tense, your subconscious is better at guarding its secrets because it’s operating in flight or fight.
- The difficulty of seeking truth means that most of us would rather choose to distract ourselves by something rather than seek the truth behind our current situation.
  - For example: the vicious procrastination cycle.

### 5) Truth seeking requires (? maybe this goes in above)

Now, I don’t mean actively choosing to do it, that can happen.

Getting truths from your subconscious requires the same compassion, patience as getting other people to open up to you.

If you judge what someone is saying, or brush aside their idea, or tell them it’s stupid, they’re not going to share more things with you obviously.

The same principle applies when coaxing truths out of your subconscious.

You can’t hold it by the neck and ask for it.

When it presents itself though a thought or feeling, you can’t judge it and try to push it away. If you do, well, just like another person, it’s going to stop wanting to share things with you.

The only way to open up is to treat it with compassion and calmly accept whatever it shares with you. Make it comfortable. Treat it as a friend.

### 6) Truth seeking cannot happen in autopilot (it should not become mechanical).

It’s easy to fall into the trap of doing things robotically, out of habit, like a routine.

Those who drive often don’t consciously perceive that they’re driving. They just do it out of habit.

Much of life ends up turning into a mindless habit, and any truth seeking practice runs the risk of turning into a mindless habit as well.

This is the greatest challenge with using time as a means to measure the productivity of a truth seeking practice. You’ll get a dopamine hit by checking off a box in your todo list for, say, practicing for 40 minutes, while it could have been a mindless exercise.

It’s tragically hilarious that a mind-”ful” practice can quickly devolve into a mind-”less” exercise if you’re not careful.

Be cautious about applying standard productivity measurement techniques to truth seeking.

## Apply your training

Truth seeking works well with other techniques to help you improve decision making, managing stress.

As you become better at seeking internal truths, and you build the muscle of observing what’s happening inside, you’ll become better at activating that muscle in realtime.

Above, I’ve presented training your mind as some practice that you carve out time for to do, and once you’re done, you’re done.

But, like how going to the gym to train your body enables you to apply that body in stronger ways in the real world, training your mind in your mental “gym” session allows you to apply that objective observation of reality muscle in realtime when you need it.

The way it manifests is that you’ll be much quicker at catching thoughts and feelings that arise in a particular situation.

For example, when you’re analyzing

- Talk about how seeking truth forces you to take more ownership (using the conscious contradiction minimization that happens. When you see that you’re the cause, you can’t help but take ownership because otherwise it creates a contradiction).

You’ll find that you make better decisions, see greater possibilities, are more calm, more accepting of a rapidly changing world and environment.

## Truth seeking value is rising exponentially.

Rapid increase in technological leverage, and anxiety.

Seeking truth enables you take advantage of this leverage as a force multiplier for all the things that are required to thrive in this future.

- Rapid rate of change ⇒ more anxiety, and fears about our value in the world (all stemming from the subconscious).
-

The only thing stopping you is yourself.

As AI and technological leverage increase, the following also increase at same rate:

1. Power of each decision you make.
2. Power of each idea.

At the same time, there are more distractions now than ever before as a result of the same technologies.

Whether you take advantage of this rapid change or succumb to it depends on your ability to seek truth.

Dear founder,

Creating something, anything, is such a difficult thing to do.

I'm grateful for all of you that create, and those that came before us that toiled hard, and sacrificed so much for us to have what we have today.

You all inspire me in ways I can't even put into words.

We owe it to the world to do great work and to create things that help us all grow and find what we're looking for.

This is my effort to help you be more successful. I've failed more times than most. I've been to hell and back. I will do anything to help prevent anybody else from drowning in the depths of failure. I've seen my habits that keep me from succeeding, and I'm obsessively working to fix them. I have a long path in front of me, and I hope our paths cross someday. Take care.

(TODO: glimpse of upcoming essays, how they're downstream consequences of AI and truth seeking.)
(TODO: share that you're working on a company, and I'm forced to go through this thinking to ensure that this is a company that does great work, and lasts for centuries.)

---

Therefore, if you don't train your ability to seek truth, you're not maximizing your potential to do all that you want to do, and be all that you want to be.
