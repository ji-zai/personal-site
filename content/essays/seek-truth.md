title: Seeking truth is the only skill
date: April 2024
---

### Seeking truth vs. acting on beliefs

- This ought to also touch on “intelligence” as it’s commonly known vs. intuition... yeah, not sure, will figure out what goes here based on how well the ending works.

---

### Can we objectively measure ability to seek truth?

Objectivity exists to the degree that wants are similar. Two people with the exact same want can be directly compared: the one that can fulfill the want more quickly than the other has greater ability (for that want).

// By extension, there is an objectively “true value” for a belief. (need to determine where exactly this point goes. Perhaps here).

---

### Difficult wants

Some wants are difficult to fulfill. Some are easy.

In the modern world, the want for food is significantly easier to fulfill for most people than the want to build a valuable company / shape public policy / win an election / make meaningful art, etc.

The possible paths grows larger for more difficult wants, and it’s more difficult to assess the right path to take.

For example, in the modern world if you want food and have some money in your hands, you have a small set of options in front of you: groceries and cook, restaurant, free food at an event, etc. There’s only so much you can explore here before you exhaust all options. Making a movie on the other hand has too many paths that are difficult to assess which is better.

- Maybe there’s some mathematical angle here that is useful. (tree breadth vs. depth. The more possibilities, the larger the tree, and the larger the tree, the more opportunities for delusion.

---

### Small difference in ability = massive difference in results

→ Keep this minimal, there is no need to get into crazy theory, or get too technical. That’s not the point of this.

→ Actually I do need to get into the power law - but perhaps the more detailed example can come later.

---

### What impacts your ability to get what you want?

_And define that this ability depends on ability to navigate_

For now, let’s ignore factors about the world such as the level of technology available, whether you have the liberty to act freely, etc. Let’s fix all of those factors by saying you’re a person living in a place with access to the internet, the freedom to consume information freely, and can share your thinking with the world.

### Internal factors

Now, there are two ways to think about ability: what factors determine your ability right now, in this moment, and how your ability changes over time, and how much of that change you can control.

A good analogy is to think about professional runners who are running the 100m race at the olympics. Their ability to perform in the race depends on a set of factors such as the power in their muscles, fuel in their bodies, how anxious they are, etc. And how their ability changes over time, and how much of that they can control tells us about the best training programs and lifestyle that will enable them to mold their minds and bodies in a way that maximizes their ability to perform well in future races.

Similarly for us, understanding the factors that determine ability to get what we want help us understand the areas where we ought to focus on in order to train this skill. Understanding how this ability changes over time and how much of that change we can control helps us see how to act and train ourselves to become better at this skill, to the extent that it is a skill (i.e. that we have control over).

There are four factors of yourself that determine ability to get what you want because they directly impact your ability to navigate the truth seeking search tree.

1. Conditioning
2. Memory
3. Ability to act
4. Willpower.

Your current conditioning of the mind for your current want determines how your mind observes, understands, values, and predicts based on the information your senses perceive. And, as we discussed earlier, your conditioning can be felt as a “pull” towards a certain way of doing things.

Memory is the ability to recall a belief as a thought. For example, when you feel a want for food, memory is your ability to recall that you have leftovers in the refrigerator.

Your ability to operate against your conditioning is your ability to resist the pull you feel towards a particular way of doing things. If you have a want for food, and your mind is conditioned to only observe, understand, value and predict in a way that leads you to junk food, this ability is your ability to wait the pull out without caving in. For a lack of a better word at the moment, let’s call this “willpower”. But I think it’s a poor word to describe the actual ability, which I’ll cover in a future essay.

Your ability to act in the world is your literal ability, physical, mental, etc. to do the things that you believe you need to do in order to get what you want. Acting is what separates those that have valuable beliefs and those with valuable beliefs who actually get what they want with those beliefs.

To understand how each factor impacts our ability to get what we want, let’s take two individuals Alice, and Bob, with the exact same difficult want, meaning the want will require significant truth seeking to fulfill because there are a vast number of paths one could take to fulfill it.

---

### Difference in conditioning

Let’s say they are equivalent in all factors except for current conditioning. Even though they have the same exact beliefs in this moment, same ability to act, same willpower, their paths will diverge because they observe, understand, value, and predict differently. The longer they seek truth to get what they want, the further their paths will diverge, leading one to drastically outperform the other to get what they want, if their conditioning nudges them in the right way,

You may wonder about the scenario in which both of their willpowers are sufficient to override each of their conditionings, which would result in them taking the same exact path since all other factors are equal. In practice this is incredibly unlikely, because, as we’ll see later, it would mean that we have the power to override all of our biases at will, and so few, if any, of us can accomplish this that I’d consider this impossible for now.

As we saw earlier, a belief is also represented as conditioning in the mind, so difference in conditioning also implies a difference in beliefs. Two people with the same exact conditionings believe the same exact things, only to different degrees based on the strength of their conditionings.

---

### Difference in memory

---

### Difference in willpower

Given all factors equal, a difference in willpower would lead to a difference in the path taken during seeking truth because it means that one will have more control over what they do. Willpower allows resisting the conditioning, so one with greater willpower would be able to, for example, spend more time seeking truth at a particular layer int he tree, without going down deeper (i.e. chasing the sub-want).

But willpower falls short in that you need to be able to "see" the conditioning if you want to be able to "override" it. But what happens when you don't even realize that your conditioning is pushing you in a certain direction? How can you override that?

---

### Difference in ability to act

Two individuals differing in their ability to act on their beliefs, with all other factors kept equal (conditioning, memory, willpower), will take different paths.

Inability to act takes different forms. It can slow you down, completely block you from a path you want to take, or even condition your mind to not even see certain paths.

For example, when one individual has a slower mental processing power, they will lag behind the one that can think things through faster, calculate faster and decide faster. With all else being equal, these two individuals will take similar paths, but one faster than the other.

But if mental processing is too slow, the world could change significantly, rendering their plans obsolete or less impactful by the time they get around to doing it. So the faster the world changes, the less “room” exists to be slow because its penalty is greater.

Sometimes a path can be completely blocked off, either due to personal incompetence or due of external circumstances. There may be two brilliant startup founders with the same exact idea and competence, yet one has to take up a job to support their family while the other has the ability to pursue their idea. This individual that joins a job will likely take a very different path to get what they want, or may even change what they want in due time.

Interestingly, the mind, in order to protect itself from lack of satiation, will condition itself to not even consider, value, and sometimes even see, paths that it believes you cannot act on in order to get what you want.

---

### Priority

One factor can impact the other. They aren’t completely independent as I’ve made them seem.

Someone with a strong willpower, but an even stronger conditioning (that pulls them away from getting what they want) is worse off than someone with weak willpower, but conditioning that actually helps them get what they want - because they don’t have to override it much.

Someone who is slightly slower to act than another, but has a slightly better conditioning than the other, (and all else kept equal), will do better because in their case the inability to act only slows them down (relative to the other), rather than completely change their path. In that case, I’d bet on the better conditioning.

Someone with great conditioning but amnesia will likely perform better than someone without amnesia but terrible conditioning. For example, if Steve Jobs were alive with amnesia, I would still run product ideas and designs by him to get his “feel” for it. Though he may not be able to explain why, his intuition is still likely to be right, and I’d bet this feedback would be orders of magnitude more helpful than from someone who has only read theory on how to build great products, and remembers the theory well, but doesn’t have the conditioning required to form an intuition about them.

So prioritizing clearly depends on the individual. But for an individual, I believe these factors are not equally contributing to an their ability to get what they want - in that moment in time, and that there would be a top factor that is the main bottleneck for them.

In order to better understand how these factors impact individuals and how these factors change over time, it’ll help to look at some examples of people becoming better at what they do and study how they did so.

---

### All positive qualities can be derived from these core factors

Focus = memory + willpower. Steve Jobs was right about “focus is about saying no”.

Resilience = willpower to resist your conditioning that wants to push you away from a scenario that doesn’t have satiation.

Judgement = Seeking truth well so that your beliefs are aligned with reality, valuable, and so that you have a more granular notion of values of truths, so that you can prioritize effectively. And

Self-awareness = the ability to see (in this context this would be “feel” since conditioning manifests as a feeling) how your mind is conditioned.

Good taste = having good conditioning such that your mind produces good predictions.

Discernment = having good conditioning such that your value function is more granular: you can see the difference between the value of two beliefs whereas others would see them as equal.

---

### Four stages of mastery

Each stage corresponds to a change in ability (i.e. conditioning, memory, ability to act, willpower).

1. _Novice_ = has no useful conditioning, no useful beliefs to recall (memory), minimal ability to act since they don’t know the tools, methodologies, techniques, frameworks of the craft. They may have willpower, which may have been trained separately from this process of getting what you want.
2. _Average_ = has some conditioning that makes them somewhat useful to their teams, and companies, has some useful beliefs to recall, has some ability to act: by mimicking others, intellectually learning certain techniques, frameworks, etc.
3. _Great_ = intuition. But even greats eventually become outdated.
4. _Master_ = a great that can become & remain great in a rapidly changing world.

---

### A novice that wants to build a company

To understand these stages, let’s take the example of a novice entrepreneur that wants to solve a problem in the world by creating a product, and by extension building a company.

When they first have this want, they likely don’t know much about how to fulfill it. They may not know much about the problem they want to solve, or how to go about tackling it.

This is the first, novice stage: they haven’t built up any conditioning to fulfill this want (i.e. they have a weak ability to observe, understand, value, and predict in a way that enables them to seek truth well), they don’t have any valuable beliefs to recall (memory), they haven’t learned the techniques, frameworks, intellectual knowledge for how to approach it (ability to act). They may have some willpower trained on other activities, or perhaps even something they cultivated innately.

---

### A novice mimics

A novice will eventually seek truth for how to fulfill this want. But, because they don’t have any conditioning yet to fulfill this want, they’ll do some research, look at others that who the novice considers “successful” and will start mimicking them.

That may sound dismissive, but how else would a novice know what to do to fulfill a difficult want? If they don’t have any conditioning, it means that their functions of observing, understanding, valuing and predicting are quite deluded - mis-aligned with reality, and they’re confused.

The novice’s mind will start to observe those that it thinks are “successful”, in order to copy them. And it often chooses who to mimic based on some notion of status. Why status? Well, what other way is there? A novice doesn’t have sufficient understanding to analyze the foundations of what makes a great company, or the nature of the problem they’re trying to solve before they decide what to do.

Our novice will likely look at those successful at building companies and will believe the path they took to do so. They’ll find them on social media, award lists, and will generally gravitate towards those with larger followings.

I definitely followed this approach when I was starting out, and I suspect everyone has to some extent. It’s tough to find another way.

---

### The average

Our novice has binged a bunch of videos, followed some superstar entrepreneurs on social platforms, and eventually they decide that the best step for them to take to be able to build a company is to join a company that is solving the problem they care about.

Most likely they choose this path because the superstar entrepreneurs they follow online seem to have taken the path of joining an incredible startup before starting their own, and perhaps because their friends that they respect also seem to be taking this path.

So the novice works hard to land a job at a company that matches their criteria. Through a similar truth seeking journey they may decide that the best way to get in is to have a college degree, so they spend a few years getting one, applying and eventually getting into a good company.

After working incredibly hard at the company for a few years, our novice has graduated to become average.

The average is conditioned in a way that allows them to observe, understand, value, and predict truths that allow them to continue to be useful to their team, and thereby company. This means they likely build intuition for what their teammates and managers expect of them, as well as intuition for what to do, say, and how to act within the company in order to meet the goals set for them.

In addition to conditioning, the average has more tools and frameworks they can apply that improves their ability to act.

While the novice may not even know intellectually how a company operates, or how products are built, the average does. Unlike the novice, the average has the ability to create value for their company. Depending on their role, they may know how to get and process feedback from customers, analyze it to make decisions, present findings to the company, how to build software, etc. They’re effective.

Most of us who work hard will eventually reach the stage of being average at what we do (as defined above).

---

### Note: The average are better than their name sounds.

By this definition of average, there are likely millionaires, billionaires even, and could have done work that was truly meaningful and beneficial to humanity that would be considered “average” according to this framework.

And so, I want to be clear, I’m not using the label “average” to be condescending, I simply couldn’t find a more appropriate word. I couldn’t use “good” because that makes it sound too close to “great”, which it’s not. There’s a monumental difference between average and great. So much so, that today, the average is just a slight step up from novice. Eventually the average will, surprisingly, be worse than the novice. We’ll see why later when we analyze how the world is changing and what that means for the ability to get what you want.

<aside>
💡 You’re probably average. I know I’m average - which is actually why I’m writing this damn essay in the first place! I felt thinking this through was necessary to become better at getting what I want, which I later realized meant becoming better at seeking truth.
</aside>

---

### Great : average = intuition : bias.

The difference between the great and the average is the difference between intuition and bias.

Unfortunately our common definitions for intuition and bias suck at accurately explaining what they are and how they relate to each other. According to the dictionary: “Bias” = “_the action of supporting or opposing a particular person or thing in an unfair way”._ “Intuition” = “the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.”

_What these definitions hide is that intuition and bias are the same exact thing!_ They’re both just conditioning. The mind has no internal distinction between intuition and bias.

We refer to a conditioning as intuition when it helps us get what we want (which usually happens when the conditioning is aligned with reality), and bias when it doesn’t help us get what we want (when conditioning is mis-aligned with reality). Therefore the degree of delusion in our conditioning determines whether a conditioning is an intuition or bias.

_Where to talk about how a belief itself is conditioning → you can’t simply decide you’re going to stop believing._

- And need to explain the difference between memory and conditioning. (Amnesia. A racist that loses ability to recall beliefs will still have a negative feeling when they see someone from a race they dislike).

---

### Whether conditioning is bias or intuition depends on the want

- What you consider to be bias, another may use it as intuition if it helps them get what they want.
- E.g. those that believe in God.
- E.g. Ramanujan.

---

### The average are far more biased than greats

The average’s mind is conditioned towards being relevant for their company, not towards being able to solve a problem meaningfully for the world, even though that’s what they want (or thought they wanted).

What causes satiation in the mind is what the mind conditions itself towards.

The average is satiated by positive feedback from their teammates and who they report to. But why is that a problem? Well, it isn’t a problem if who they work with are incredibly well aligned with the reality of the world such that making the team happy is equivalent to solving this problem for the world. But that’s obviously far from the case.

In the case of a team of people trying to solve a problem in the world,

For the average, satiation doesn’t fulfill their want (to solve a problem).

And the cause for satiation for the average is often another person - or a small group of people. This means that

- Proxy for the market is significantly mis-aligned from reality because of how deluded all of us are. The more people you go through before you directly interact with the truth, the more deluded you are - on top of all the ways you’re deluded individually.
- This is precisely why large companies fail.

---

### Proxies between you and reality compound delusion exponentially

And you are one of them! We ourselves can’t see reality as it is due to the limitations of our selves - only a minor portion of what senses captures enter our conscious mind through our conditioning. As we saw earlier, we ourselves are so terribly deluded.

Now, adding another person between you and reality means that your starting point is with all of their delusions!

And purely based on the numbers, most people with the want to solve a problem for the world work at large companies since those companies hire the most people. Therefore most people that want to positively impact the world have many layers of proxies between them and reality, conditioning them in ways that optimizes their conditioning for the delusions of their specific companies and teams, rather than towards solving the problem they want to solve for the world.

And each company is incredibly deluded about the world - just in slightly different ways. (ofc need to substantiate this). - ie: “each proxy is incredibly deluded”. - and even those we consider GREATS are also incredibly deluded. - it is a limitation of the human condition.

- Your senses are also just a proxy for reality! We already know of phenomena we can measure in the universe that we can’t perceive through our senses. → This is an important point. Which is why even if you want to make something people want, you often only work with proxies: each individual customer

---

### Can you control your satiation?

Is it possible to not let praise from your team and manager get to you and only allow yourself to be satiated by how well the market appreciates your impact?

This is assuming too much power in our hands. The old adage “you are the average of the people you spend time with” is true because evolution has made us care deeply about pleasing those around us.

Even those that you wouldn’t consider “people pleasers” are still deeply people pleasers, perhaps just a bit less than you and me. This conditioning is deeply ingrained, and for good reason! It helps us survive by enabling us to cooperate, and appease each other to garner the support and protection of the collective - which likely led to our ancestors surviving and reproducing.

Therefore, I think you’re deluded if you think you can override thousands of years of evolutionary programming by simply willing yourself to not allow certain kinds of satiation that your mind is hardwired to crave. The average cannot help but be average unless they’re at a special company that doesn’t suffer from the usual, monumental, delusion we find within companies (and my hunch is the number of such companies can be counted on my two hands).

This is also why many scientists fear the hit of the Nobel prize because the monumental “hit” that such external validation gives you warps your conditioning subconsciously to optimize for that hit again. Everything truth you observe, understand, value, predict will be towards the hit rather than towards understanding your field of study better. And the same goes for any popular award for any field of human endeavor, or even status on social media. Interestingly, the ones that don’t fear it seem to be the ones most affected by it.

- But, there’s another problem as well: the more proxies between you and reality, the less valuable feedback becomes.

---

### Greats are paranoid about what satiates them

→ In other words, they’re paranoid about how their minds are conditioned.

→ Average founder vs. great founder.

The average usually isn’t that paranoid because if they were, they probably wouldn’t have put themselves on the path t

---

### Greats have intuition

_“The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant”_ - Einstein.

Intellectualization falls short.

You cannot effectively seek truth with rational thinking alone. It simply will not work for difficult wants because there are too many factors. This is why I’ve categorized it separately from seeking - it is a necessary aid to be able to act in our world, but it is far from the most valuable tool we have, and not acknowledging this is one of the greatest mistakes novices and the average make.

The crux:

- Intuition must be precisely explained in terms of **observe, understand, value, and predict**. And show how this drastically outperforms
- See observations the average cannot see. Understand observations in ways that the average cannot. Value function is more subtle, and prediction leads to sub-branches that are simply more fruitful - that won’t even arrive in the mind of the average.
  - Perhaps it will arrive after spending a lot of time, but that’s not clear, and my hunch is that the time required is much longer than most people are willing to put up with.

→ The Steve Jobs example vs. an employee at Apple.

→ The top tier scientist approach vs. the average scientist.

→ A great filmmaker vs. the average one.

→ The average will realize the gap once they try to do something great.

---

### Yet, even greats become outdated

Many seem to think this is because it’s tougher to exert themselves or because their minds aren’t as sharp, etc. But I believe the primary reason greats become outdated is because their intuition turns into bias.

Conditioning that worked for them at one point eventually stop working to help them get what they want.

---

### Truths expire

Intuition becomes bias because every truth has an expiry date when it will cease to be true. _(note: in all likelihood, even the truths about our universe, and physical world will likely expire at some point - just far beyond any practical timeline - there is no evidence to believe they won’t, and the safer belief is to believe that the truths of the universe follow the same pattern as any other truths we’ve uncovered)._

---

### Intuition morphs into bias every single moment

(Need to reference theory of mind in which we see how conditioning happens every moment).

We’re becoming more biased by the moment.

And there’s only so much we can do to prevent this.

Can’t the great just focus on conditioning towards the truths that don’t expire? This is a great strategy - one that the master employs. But, the challenge is that it’s impossible to operate only on timeless beliefs.

To get what you want from the world, you need to meet it where it is, not where you want it to be.

→ A filmmaker that makes a ‘1910’s style film with outdated language and cultural references, likely won’t appeal to the current world (even themselves! as they too are conditioned by the modern world) - likely won’t make something they like, and by extension others appreciate.

→ An entrepreneur that doesn’t meet the world where it is today, no matter how well they understand the nature of the mind and the root cause for the problem they’re trying to solve, can’t build their product in a way that the world accepts it.

You can’t avoid believing in temporary truths because most truths we operate on are temporary.

<aside>
💡 Therefore, intuition is guaranteed to turn into bias at the rate at which the truths you rely on expire.

</aside>

---

### Human progress accelerates change

---

### Exponential change

- Really dive into what this means with parables, and talk about how unintuitive it is.
- We aren’t evolved to handle this.

Truths always expired, but they didn’t expire nearly as quickly as they do today.

Even as recent as a few decades ago, you could continue to get what you want by allowing yourself to condition yourself deeply to your beliefs.

- That strategy no longer works.

---

### The average’s conditioning will be outdated by the time it’s conditioned

- Only the novice, greats and masters will be valued.
- Novice ought to figure out path to mastery and do their best to skip the average stage entirely. - unfortunately our world is designed to train for the average. Modern education has many, many proxies between a student and reality, leading to the biases of teachers and modern day “experts” passing onto students like a deadly virus - a virus more harmful than any pandemic we’ve ever experienced or will experience.
- A great example: imagine someone training to become good at Chess or Go, and every minute the rules of the game change in some way. Sometimes the change is small, sometimes it’s massive. (You can really dive into this example - it’s a great thought experiment).

---

### Paradox: skyrocketing salaries alongside a massive job crunch

- Show how this is already here.
- Predict how this will become more pronounced (and I predict this will happen even if we fix education).

---

### A master has better control over their conditioning

- And this isn’t through sheer willpower - as we saw earlier, willpower only works for conditioning you can see, but not the conditioning that you’re blind to. (reference the piece above).
- They have choice over how they are conditioned.
  - Even greats are smart enough to put themselves in situations that minimize satiation that goes against what they want, but a master has control over how strongly they are satiated.
  - This means a master can choose to condition or de-condition their mind at will:
  - They have a set of techniques, both individual and collaborative that minimize their delusions.
  - And they can see their conditioning more clearly than the rest of us. They’re skillful in navigating their outdated conditioning that prevents them from getting what they want.

---

### We don’t even know what we want (conditioning is blinding)

- Intellectual understanding ≠ knowing because conditioning is not intellectual.
- The mind will make the jump from “I’m voting for X” to “I am X” without you even realizing. The mind wants to latch onto things quickly and fiercely. Countering this tendency isn’t as easy as it may seem at first glance. (not sure how this point applies here - but it’s a critical point).
- Conscious vs. subconscious.

---

### In order to get what we want, we have no choice but to fall into the traps of our conditioning

Going back to the example of the Nobel laureate who can’t do good work [anymore](http://anymore.In): in most situations the right truth seeking move is to operate in ways that our outdated conditioning latches onto.

For example, becoming popular feeds self-preservation, but is also incredibly valuable for seeking truth: it allows the world to criticize your ideas, which helps you improve more quickly. But it also sets a massive trap: the more you allow the popularity to satiate you, the more you’ll be derailed from getting what you consciously want.

---

### The average feel that world is changing too fast. Greats embrace it. Masters crave even faster change

- Masters don’t crave more change for sadistic reasons, but rather because they know that more change leads to faster improvement and less suffering for the world. More rapid change means that we’ll more quickly have improvements for all human problems - from global warming, diseases, etc. The slower the world changes, the longer we hold onto our problems that cause immense suffering for most that live in the world.
- This doesn’t mean that everyone that craves more change is a master, but the point is that the master benefits from change in ways that no one else does.
- And greater change in the direction things are changing in, means that masters will have better tools at their disposal to seek truth and get what they want.

---

### Seeking truth is the only skill

- Ability to act will be democratized.
- Human progress equalizes ability to act (i.e. gives everyone greater leverage). Acknowledge the significant lack of equality of opportunity, but show that it’s rapidly evolving in the right direction.
- Human progress isn’t just technology. It’s culture, politics, decentralization, etc. as well. All the world wants is to maximize transactions, creating the necessary incentives to create equal opportunity.

---

### A master’s skill is more generalizable than the great’s

---

### The human potential

- The efficient market hypothesis paints a deluded picture of the world.
- Draw a bar with the top being the best we can do, and a line towards the top that shows where we are, in this moment in time. This efficient market hypothesis makes you believe that we are much higher than reality.
- In reality: the line is too close to the bottom to even represent the difference with one pixel, and therefore it could not even be drawn on your screen. Yes, that’s how fucking off we are from what we could be. The human potential.

---

### Concluding thoughts

I hope by now we're aligned on how important the ability to seek truth is, how it is the essence of any skill we value, and just how terribly difficult it is to be good at it. We have a glimpse of what the stages of mastery look like, but it's still quite unclear what is the best training strategy is - to become a master at seeking truth.

That's the focus of my next essay. It's a nuanced, difficult path. Fortunately, we have masters in the our world today, and in the past, that we can study to make sense of how they developed their mastery.

This journey to understand how to become a master will also involve grounding our theory of mind in neurobiology. After all, if a master has greater control over how their mind is conditioned, then we need to dive deeper into understanding what conditioning even is. My current model of conditioning as I shared in this essay is far from having the accuracy required in order to describe the path to mastery.

I also believe the path to mastery is far from a solo path. It's incredibly difficult to see our own delusions and conditionings that prevent us from seeing reality as it is, and therefore friends that can show us our delusions are invaluable. So, understanding the path to mastery will also require studying what it means to collaborate and to make friends on our path to mastering seeking truth.

I need your feedback! Especially if you have any life experiences or beliefs that contradict with the theories I've proposed above. Certainly my theories are deluded to some degree, because I'm an incredibly deluded person, as are you. But the beauty of our species is that you and I are bound to be deluded differently. So your feedback can help show me my own delusions. Please be as critical as you can be. I'll be grateful for it.
