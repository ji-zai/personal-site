## What is truth.

To understand truth, you need to understand what delusion is.

If you take any system, your delusion is not knowing how it works. The degree of delusion is the degree to which you don't understand how it works.

Let's define a system as something in which we can can act, and it responds with some reaction.

Action and reaction, cause and effect, input and output are all the same ways to express this behavior of systems.

The reality of a system is the rules that govern how the system responds to some input.

Whether you observe the rules of the system or not, the system will continue to dance according to its rules. For example, in the physical system of the world, gravity will do its thing regardless of whether humans observe it or not.

A system can be anything: the physical system, digital system, biological system, mathematical system, or even the system that governs our minds: our emotions and thoughts.

We know all of these systems have some rules that govern them based on observation. Even the system that governs the human mind seems to follow some patterns. If it were a system with no rules, there can be no cause and effect and we would be exhibiting purely random behavior all the time.

The process of seeking truth about a system is the process of understanding the reality of a system.

When you say "seeking truth" it's implied that it's about a system, because by how we've defined things, there is no truth / delusion without a system that it corresponds to.

And this also means that you could be more deluded about one system than another. You have a different delusion <> system relationship for each system you are involved in.

Seeking truth means that you're acting in the system. When you act and the system reacts, you discover something about the nature of the system: the laws that govern it.

The statements: "uncovering a truth" is the exact equivalent to "reducing delusion". You reduce delusion to the extent that the uncovered truth shows you the reality of the system.

So, if you want anything, then you'll want to understand the reality of the systems that govern the things you want, so that you can provide the system inputs that gets the outputs you want.

If you were not deluded about any system, you would make absolutely no mistakes in your pursuit of getting what you want, because you would know all systems in the universe perfectly.

A mistake here is simply: you would not do some action A expecting a reaction Y, and get Z instead.

So clearly all of us are deluded to some extent about most systems that exist in the universe because we obviously make mistakes.

Let's take look at a simple system: a system that takes one input (x) and outputs that same input (x). And let's say that this behavior doesn't change over time.

You know everything there is to know about this system without having to explore anything at all. You know the truth, and have no delusion.

Let's add some complexity.

Let's say the system could take one input (x) that can take either the value (x=a) or (x=b), and can return either (y) or (z).

You have some delusion about this system because you don't know which input will lead to which output by the system. The only way to know is to explore this system by running it with some input that it can take.
