The ability to seek truth is the most valuable skill for a founder.

Any human creation we value is based on some truth(s) about the world, or mind. You need to be able to seek truth in order to do great work.

As AI improves exponentially fast, the value of truth seeking rises in tandem. Fortunately, it's a skill that can be trained.

## Youâ€™re deluded

To understand truth seeking, you need to understand what truth is. And to understand truth, you need to understand what delusion is.

If you take any system, your delusion is not knowing how it works. The degree of delusion is the degree to which you don't understand how it works.

If you were not deluded, you would make absolutely no mistakes. So clearly we're all deluded to some extent about most, if not all, systems that exist in the universe.

We reduce our delusion about a system by uncovering truths about it.
The statements: "uncovering a truth" is the exact equivalent to "reducing delusion". We reduce delusion to the extent that the uncovered truth shows us the reality of the system.

The entire truth often doesn't present itself all at once, but rather in chunks. We uncover truths about a system by exploring that system.

Of course, not all exploration is of the same quality. Randomly exploring a system and not taking note of what you already know, what you might not know and not planning anything leads to wasted time and effort.

And so, as humanity evolved, we improved our ability to plan our exploration.

For any system, we start with some model of what we think the reality of that system is, what truths we already know about the system (through previous exploration), to what degree our confidence is about each truth we already know (because not all discoveries from explorations are certain), and based on this information, we plan ways to explore the system to improve our understanding of its reality.

When we come across a truth that disagrees with our model of the system, we methodically work through how to update our model to more accurately represent reality. This often involves a combination questioning our confidence in previous truths, questioning how we interpreted the results of previous explorations, and even questioning the boundary we set for the system: perhaps the system is larger, more encompassing, than we had originally thought.

This became our chosen method to better understand the world we live in.

And by definition, following this process is the absolute best we can do to understand any system, because doing anything otherwise would be introducing unnecessary randomness into the process.

And best here means understanding it the most quickly we can possibly hope to understand it.

To be clear, we're still following the optimal path if we choose a random area to explore IF our current model of the system has dark areas that we believe to be all equally potentially valuable to explore.

Choosing a random area to explore by itself doesn't pollute our method, but rather adding randomness to our planning for how we choose is what pollutes the method.

Now, you might say that it may not be the fastest way to explore the system by giving the example of two individuals exploring the same system without having any information from the other person. By following the most optimal strategy, one person might understand the entire system faster than the other.

How can that be?

Because not all truths are created equal.

So, if at any point in an understanding of a model there are equally valued unknown areas to explore, unless in reality they both reveal an equal magnitude of truth, there is guaranteed to be a factor of "luck" that is beyond our control in how quickly we can understand a system.

Based on what we've seen in the world, we know for a fact that not all truths we discover are of equal magnitude. And in fact, they follow the power law: the "top" truths have uncovered orders of magnitudes more about our world than the "lowest" truths.

And we have no reason to believe that this isn't the case for all systems that can be explored.

Therefore, let's take this power law of truth quality to be a truth - with a high confidence (which for all practical purposes is full confidence).

Therefore, we know that there's a factor of luck in how quickly we can explore any system, that is completely out of our control.

## What we know about the system of a person

We know that people want things. That thing could be a physical thing, or a feeling.

Just like "delusion" is the exact flip of "truth", one is exactly the absence of the other, we need to define the opposite of wanting (i.e. not wanting). So let's define "pain" as not wanting.

Which means, when someone feels pain, it means they want something that relieves them of that pain.

And we know that the nature of pain changes over time. When a person feels a pain and they want something that removes the pain, and they get that which they wanted, that relief doesn't last forever.

And we can confidently assume this because we haven't seen a single example of someone who wants nothing for their entire existence. They might not want something sometimes, but they're bound to want something again later because some pain or the other arises in them.

In order to make something that at a person wants, what you create must releive a pain they have, by definition.

And by definition, you would only create something a person wants if it relieved some pain for you because if it didn't you wouldn't even have the want to create it.

So, by definition, there's must be a reduction in pain for you everytime you do something you want. Without such a reduction in pain you wouldn't do it again (unless you were crazy. And please remember, this is all by definition so far).

But wait, isn't a mother's love self-less? According to our definition, the mother would only care for her child if it impacted her level of pain. And clearly not caring for her child causes mothers unimaginable pain because a mother is wired such that when they see their children suffer, they feel unimaginable pain.

And so, a mother will do everything in her power to protect her children from feeling pain.

Let's take 2 people A and B.

If A wants something B has, and B wants something A has, there's a possibility for a transaction that depends on the magnitudes of the wants.

If by giving B something that Be wants causes more pain to A that what they received from B didn't remove, then A wouldn't want to give B what B wants. The transaction wouldn't happen if both A, and B have agency (freedom to act or not act) in the situation.

Let's call that the transaction criteria.

Based on what we've observed in the world, a transaction only between A, and B when:

1. The transaction criteria has been met between them.
2. There's a way for A and B to know that each other exists and that the transaction criteria has been met.
3. There's a way for them to transfer to each other that which each other wants.
4. There is the necessary force created that completes the transaction.

What's this "force"?

The force is determined by the agency of A and B. After meeting the first 3 criteria:

If A and B both have agency, then the force required to complete the transaction is entirely between them. If they agree to transact, it happens, else it doesn't.

If one doesn't have agency, then the other can force the transaction by applying force.

If both don't have agency, then the transaction happens whether they want it to or not.

Let's summarize what we have so far:

1. You will only want something if you feel pain.
2. You will only make something if making it has the possibility of easing your pain.
3. You will only transact (with agency) if someone else has something that you want, and you have something they want.

Humans, then, cleverly created an abstraction called money that removed the need for A to have exactly what B wants, and B to have exactly what A wants.

So, if you want money, it means that you want what someone else has, that you believe will give you what you want from them in exchange for money.

The amount of money they want needs to match the transaction criteria. Therefore each must value what they're receiving from the other more than they value what they're giving the other.

And they will value money according to what they believe they can get for it, naturally because the same thought process above for why you want money, applies to them as well.

Therefore, if A and B have agency, they must both gain from the transaction, else it wouldn't occur because the transaction criteria wouldn't have been met.

Let's be clear what we have so far:

1.
