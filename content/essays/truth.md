The ability to seek truth is the most valuable skill.

Any human creation you value is based on some truth(s) about the world, or mind. You need to be able to seek truth in order to do work that matters to you. And doing work that matters to you is better for you, me, and everyone.

As AI improves exponentially fast, the value of truth seeking rises in tandem.

Fortunately, it's a skill that can be trained.
Unfortunately, there's no time. The training must start now.

## Youâ€™re deluded

To understand truth seeking, you need to understand what truth is. And to understand truth, you need to understand what delusion is.

If you take any system, your delusion is not knowing how it works. The degree of delusion is the degree to which you don't understand how it works.

If you were not deluded, you would make absolutely no mistakes. So clearly we're all deluded to some extent about most, if not all, systems that exist in the universe.

We reduce our delusion about a system by uncovering truths about it.
The statements: "uncovering a truth" is the exact equivalent to "reducing delusion". We reduce delusion to the extent that the uncovered truth shows us the reality of the system.

The entire truth often doesn't present itself all at once, but rather in chunks. We uncover truths about a system by exploring that system.

Of course, not all exploration is of the same quality. Randomly exploring a system and not taking note of what you already know, what you might not know and not planning anything leads to wasted time and effort.

And so, as humanity evolved, we improved our ability to plan our exploration.

For any system, we start with some model of what we think the reality of that system is, what truths we already know about the system (through previous exploration), to what degree our confidence is about each truth we already know (because not all discoveries from explorations are certain), and based on this information, we plan ways to explore the system to improve our understanding of its reality.

When we come across a truth that disagrees with our model of the system, we methodically work through how to update our model to more accurately represent reality. This often involves a combination questioning our confidence in previous truths, questioning how we interpreted the results of previous explorations, and even questioning the boundary we set for the system: perhaps the system is larger, more encompassing, than we had originally thought.

This became our chosen method to better understand the world we live in.

And by definition, following this process is the absolute best we can do to understand any system, because doing anything otherwise would be introducing unnecessary randomness into the process.

And best here means understanding it the most quickly we can possibly hope to understand it.

To be clear, we're still following the optimal path if we choose a random area to explore IF our current model of the system has dark areas that we believe to be all equally potentially valuable to explore.

Choosing a random area to explore by itself doesn't pollute our method, but rather adding randomness to our planning for how we choose is what pollutes the method.

Now, you might say that it may not be the fastest way to explore the system by giving the example of two individuals exploring the same system without having any information from the other person. By following the most optimal strategy, one person might understand the entire system faster than the other.

How can that be?

Because not all truths are created equal.

So, if at any point in an understanding of a model there are equally valued unknown areas to explore, unless in reality they both reveal an equal magnitude of truth, there is guaranteed to be a factor of "luck" that is beyond our control in how quickly we can understand a system.

Based on what we've seen in the world, we know for a fact that not all truths we discover are of equal magnitude. And in fact, they follow the power law: the "top" truths have uncovered orders of magnitudes more about our world than the "lowest" truths.

And we have no reason to believe that this isn't the case for all systems that can be explored.

Therefore, let's take this power law of truth quality to be a truth - with a high confidence (which for all practical purposes is full confidence).

Therefore, we know that there's a factor of luck in how quickly we can explore any system, that is completely out of our control.

## An individual

We know that people want things. That thing could be a physical thing, or a feeling.

Just like "delusion" is the exact flip of "truth", one is exactly the absence of the other, we need to define the opposite of wanting (i.e. not wanting). So let's define "pain" as not wanting.

Which means, when someone feels pain, it means they want something that relieves them of that pain.

And we know that the nature of pain changes over time. When a person feels a pain and they want something that removes the pain, and they get that which they wanted, that relief doesn't last forever.

And we can confidently assume this because we haven't seen a single example of someone who wants nothing for their entire existence. They might not want something sometimes, but they're bound to want something again later because some pain or the other arises in them.

In order to make something that at a person wants, what you create must releive a pain they have, by definition.

And by definition, you would only create something a person wants if it relieved some pain for you because if it didn't you wouldn't even have the want to create it.

So, by definition, there's must be a reduction in pain for you everytime you do something you want. Without such a reduction in pain you wouldn't do it again (unless you were crazy. And please remember, this is all by definition so far).

But wait, isn't a mother's love self-less? According to our definition, the mother would only care for her child if it impacted her level of pain. And clearly not caring for her child causes mothers unimaginable pain because a mother is wired such that when they see their children suffer, they feel unimaginable pain.

And so, a mother will do everything in her power to protect her children from feeling pain.

## Two individuals

Let's take 2 people A and B.

If A wants something B has, and B wants something A has, there's a possibility for a transaction that depends on the magnitudes of the wants.

If by giving B something that B wants causes more pain to A than the relief of pain from the thing they received from B, then A wouldn't want to give B what B wants. Then, the transaction wouldn't happen if both A, and B have agency (freedom to act or not act) in the situation.

Also, we have to be careful with this statement because as it is, it's not true.

Because A's willingness to transact has absolutely nothing to do with how much what B gives A actually reduce's A's pain. All A's willingness to transact depends solely on is whether they BELIEVE what they receive from B will reduce their pain more than the pain they BELIEVE will be inflicted on them by giving B what B wants.

There's a world of a difference in that subtle change, and it's one that we need to keep in mind because it's a critical piece of the puzzle to understand the world we live in.

This is of course not the only criteria that needs to be true for the transaction to happen.

Based on what we've observed in the world, all of the following need to be true for the transaction to happen. Let's call this the "transaction criteria".

Transaction criteria:

1. A can make something B wants, and B can make something A wants, such that what B offers A is is believed by A to reduce their pain more than what they believe giving B what B wants will cause.
2. A and B to know that each other exists and that the transaction criteria has been met.
3. A and B have a way for them to transfer to each other that which each other wants.
4. There is the necessary agency to complete the transaction.

After meeting the first 3 requirements:

If A and B both have agency, the transaction happens.

If one doesn't have agency, then the other can force the transaction by applying force. And they will have no choice but to apply that force if they BELIEVE by having what the other has will lead to greater pain reduction than the effort to apply the force necessary to grab it will cause.

They have no choice here if they believe

If both don't have agency, then the transaction may happen or not regardless of whether they want it to happen or not. It's up to the laws of nature.

The transaction criteria itself pushed all the people bound by the transaction criteria to reduce the effort required to meet this transaction criteria.

Why?

Because a person wants things to remove their pain. And the person wants more things in the world that they believe will remove pain.

Why? Why isn't having just one thing that removes all of their pain enough?

Because the reality of the world is that the "one thing" doesn't exist (or rather because we don't believe it to exist with a high degree of confidence because we haven't seen such a thing yet.).

And therefore, rightly so, the individual believes not one thing will ease all of their pain, that multiple things are required. They don't know how many things will satisfy them, so they want for more things to exist, in the hopes that one day they will have consumed enough things to have no pain.

(Once again, an individual is forced to want things because of their pain. Remember, if they had no pain, they would want nothing - by our definitions).

When many individuals feel this way, they have no choice but to try and reduce the friction for a transaction, because that would enable more things to exist in the world that could potentially reduce the individual's pain.

How does reducing the effort required for a transaction lead to more things to exist in the world?

Because less effort to have a transaction means that the transaction happens more easily and more quickly.

Let's use an example, 3 people: A, B, C.

Let's say:

- A knows how to make something B wants using what C gave A,
- B knows how to make something C wants using what A gave B
- C knows how to make something A wants using what B gave C.

Let's say that somehow the effort for A to transact with B decreased. But there are 4 requirements for a transaction, which requirement became easier?

Let's say the first requirement becomes easier:

What are ways in which the effort for a transaction can decrease?

1. Technology.
2. Money.

## Money

Humans, then, cleverly created an abstraction called money that removed the need for A to have exactly what B wants, and B to have exactly what A wants.

So, if you want money, it means that you want what someone else has, that you believe will give you what you want from them in exchange for money.

The amount of money they want needs to match the transaction criteria. Therefore each must value what they're receiving from the other more than they value what they're giving the other.

And they will value money according to what they believe they can get for it, naturally because the same thought process above for why you want money, applies to them as well.

Therefore, if A and B have agency, they must both gain from the transaction, else it wouldn't occur because the transaction criteria wouldn't have been met.

And of course we've already established that there can be many kinds of transactions that don't involve this money abstraction because there's a direct match between A and B (they have something that the other wants, and so there's no need for money in the exchange).

## Many individuals

By how we've defined things, it's clear that a world in which more people have agency, will have more transactions.

## Organizing many, many individuals

- Ideologies on the spectrum of capitalism.
- Ideologies on the spectrum of democracy.

## Why seeking truth is the most important skill

(From here on, all downstream consequences)

## How to train truth seeking

## My truth

What I'm going to do with my life.

When you follow the truth, there's no need to make any decisions, they make themselves. The following is the plan for my life that I have no choice but to take given my worldview that I've shared above.

If my world view above changes, then I'll have no choice but to analyze the downstream consequences of those changes, and update my plan for life.

So I ask you. No, I beg you. Please force me to update my world view to be closer to the truth. I have no choice but to ask you to do this.

Humans didn't invent money, money invented itself through humans as a logical consequence of the nature of a human. There was no other way. With enough time it was bound to happen.

The only way to develop free will is to shift the craving to reduce pain from an external to internal process.
