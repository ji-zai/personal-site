# Structure

Outcome:
For each prediction:
Dimensions

1. Time (at limit, now, 2 years from now)
2. Scope (individual, small group, nation)
   So each prediction has a 3x3 matrix.
   The entire essay is working towards these predictions.

- Brief intro explaining that I believe there is only one skill that underpins all of human activity. That in and of itself isn't that useful, but what comes from it is: the ability to study the skill and therefore make predictions. If it is the only skill, then the predictions will span all aspects of our individual and collective existence.
- A sense of the predictions, their format, why that format, and what I will cover in order to justify these predictions.
- The limit: artificial intelligence competence in the skill is beyond the best human's skill. This implies AI surpasses us in every skill, since all skills can be derived from this single skill. I believe we're quite far away from this, further than many think. But, I also believe we're going to move more rapidly towards this limit in the short-term (next 5 - 10 years) than most of us believe. This will lead to a delayed reaction in how we adapt.
- The model:
  -> Seeking truth as a recursive search process.
  -> The nature of a want - that has a notion of complexity.
  -> Justify how everything can be modeled in this way.
- Understanding why we are terrible at this skill.
  -> 4 factors with an emphasis on conditioning.
- Understanding what mastery looks like using examples and 4 stages of development.
- Understanding change. (which comes by studying past, present, and then extrapolating into future).
  -> The key aspect of understanding change is understanding that what we feel is going to happen is likely far from the truth, and is getting further from the truth.
- Understanding evolution: this is the final piece: i.e. it shows what preexisting conditioning we are born with (i.e. self-preservation). Do not shit on self-preservation. It is critical for our survival. I woudn't have felt compelled to think about the future if it weren't for my underlying conditioning for self-preservation. There is a part of it that is outdated, and a part of it is not. We need to discern which is what. Nature is deluded: else it would have just created the most intelligent being possible and there would be no need for "evolution". Evolution can be seen as nature's experiments to increase life. Some work. Some don't. The ones that work, nature doubles down on and leaves behind experiments that have failed. Nature is slow. But in the same way we expect a sort of "AI takeoff", nature expects an "skill in truth seeking takeoff" that it hopes we will be capable of doing. But just because nature wants this and therefore created this pre-existing conditioning in us, and therefore has created the incentives that govern a group of individuals, it doesn't mean we will succeed. We don't know how many other experiments are being run. We don't know if there is another species of creatures elsewhere in our universe or other universes that have a greater capacity than we do. We are likely not Nature's top priority across all of its universes. We don't know if the nature in this universe can even communicate with nature in other universes - if information cannot pass through as physicists claim, then it's likely that this nature is deluded from other natures in other universes. This may sound a bit too imaginative, or philosophical, but it has very practical implications: it means that we can't depend on some external force to preserve us - it's up to us. All we received is some deep rooted conditioning to do so.

By this point we will have described the skill, what keeps us from being great at it - and therefore the opportunity for improvement, what the skill looks like in our world, how the world is changing.

What I will not cover in this essay is how to build mastery. Well, I will in terms of what we've discussed. There is a depth to it
