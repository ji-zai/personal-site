Not only is seeking truth the only skill for an individual to thrive in this world, I also believe it's the antidote to our collective problems. 

Even if someone who wants absolute power over the world today exists, if they're good at seeking truth to get that power, they'd: (the chain of events that leads them to building a decentralized, democratic country and try to become its leader).

In fact, the better the truth seeker, the more power hungry I'd want them to be.

Seeking truth forces you to be aligned with the incentives that govern our world, and those incentives do not point towards the destruction of our species. In fact, destruction would only arise from either delusion (i.e. we weren't good enough at seeking truth), or by things out of our control. If latter, well, we can't do anything about it, but we can be better at seeking truth. By many orders of magnitude.

(Also, something about delusion causing suffering and pointing to the obesity epidemic, and a range of health issues).

I want to help build a more truth seeking world, and I believe artificial intelligence will be a critical tool to help us seek truth more effectively.

For the next essay, I'm about to choose one of the following topics to explore:
1. How to be better at seeking truth (a playbook for an individual to improve).
2. What we'll need to build artificial general intelligence, and why we shouldn't be overly afraid of it.
3. What tools and cultures we'll need to build a more truth seeking world.

And naturally, at the root of all of these topics is the question: "what are we?". Invariably an exploration of any worthwhile topic will force me to tackle this question.

I'm sharing these up front because after reading this essay you feel that there's something better for me to focus on, I'd love to hear it! Each essay, when done the right way, takes me months of research. I need to choose well.

(Removed this from intro, speak to this in the conclusion when talking about how the importance of this skill goes far beyond just the individual).

For our species, technically speaking, time is the only resource that is scarce. Time is not scarce because we will die, but because we want to get what we want as quickly as possible. Even if we solve aging, time will continue to be a scarcity for us for as long as the fundamental nature of our minds doesn't change.

All other resources (except time) that we want, exist in abundance in the universe: energy, the components that make water, food, light, etc.

Therefore, the only that prevents us from solving all of humanity's external problems is our lack of understanding of the systems that govern these resources. And we gain that understanding by seeking truth.

Our progress as a species is limited by our skill to seek truth about the world we live in.
