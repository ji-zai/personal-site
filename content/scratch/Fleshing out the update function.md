This is a critical piece of the model. It determines how I can explain all of the key points which stem from this reinforcement / un-reinforcement behavior.

1. Reinforcement of the path leading to satiation / lack of satiation
2. It is a continuous process (or rather, it's likely discrete with the time interval from one update to the next is so small that we can't perceive it without some high powered equipment). This is because lack of satiation can only be represented with time: the time to satiation. The longer it takes for satiation, the more un-reinforcement of this path occurs.
3. It is not a linear process. It accelerates and decelerates rapidly (reference the stock market).
4. Reinforcement becomes tougher to break, the more it's reinforced.

Is there anything else here?
