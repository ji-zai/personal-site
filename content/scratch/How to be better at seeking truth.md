*These are just ideas. I can't dive deep into this topic without first understanding seeking truth itself.*
### Internal: De-condition unwanted reactions

- Conscious vs. subconscious models.
### Learn by doing
### Choose the right identity

### Choose what you want
### Remember what you want
In the messy process of getting what you want, it's incredibly easy to forget what you wanted in the first place, or rather, subconsciously morphing what you want without your say.

The act of reminding yourself of your want is critical in order to stay on course.
### Learn to put the mind at ease
### Minimize dogma
The cost of dogmatic beliefs is rising exponentially in tandem with technology.

Historically, you could have a dogmatic belief and it may be true for a while before it was no longer true. As change happens exponentially faster, you can no longer believe in things that will be invalidated before you even get a chance to act on that belief.

All of the following are dogmatic beliefs:

- “Work less”, “work more”
- “Move fast”, “move slow”.

The skill is in knowing when to do what. That’s always been the case, and increasingly that will be the only viable option, you can’t risk blindly following a belief system without seeking the truth about it.

(Patrick Collison talks about minimizing the number of things a company innovates on, and how the organizational structure should be left as is - since the fundamental nature of the human being hasn’t changed that much - but perhaps even the organizational structure needs to be re-evaluated).
### Minimize wants.

### Only work on things that you truly want to work on

### Minimize effort
- But this has nothing to do with the number of hours worked. That correlation is an absolute illusion.
- (I.e. talk about how the flow state is the most productive, and how it's also the least draining) => it's entirely possible to put in more hours, while also being more relaxed at the end of it.
- When you work in a direction that you truly resonate with, and you learn how to put the mind at ease.
### Collaborate
- It's easier to spot delusions in others than in yourself. Take advantage of this weakness of your mind, by teaming up with others.
- Working with the right people is paramount. There is actually nothing else more important than this.
- Characteristics of the right people to work with (basically people who embody the above points in this chapter).
	- At least intellectually understands what it means to seek truth.
	- Minimal wants.
	- Knows how to put their mind at ease.
	- Has the right identity
	- Minimizes effort - i.e. isn't one to be attached to putting in more effort than is required for the sake of appearances.
