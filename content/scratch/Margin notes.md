You might ask what happens when we want multiple things at once. I believe the mind focuses on one want at a time, and the feeling that we can multi-task probably exists because we're not aware of the subtle umps between wants that the mind is always making - sometimes within a single second.

But even if you believe otherwise (that there are multiple "threads" so to speak), understanding how a single thread operates should still be useful.

And we've found in practice that the values of truths follow the power law: the most valuable truths are orders of magnitudes more valuable than the least valuable ones. (note: will definitely need to substantiate this more, OR better: let's move this beyond the tree search - possibly towards the end, when we draw conclusions - this is a VERY important point).

Can we simultaneously have multiple wants?

- Yes, the entire branch of wants is fulfilled. (but, this comes in the section )
- Yes, but we focus on seeking truth for one at a time.

(Keep the discussion re. the root cause really short. There's no need to dig into such philosophical talk - it's not necessary to drive home the point, and I don't think people would want to dwell on that in any way since it's terrifying.)

Those who predict doomsday scenarios such as how we're already past the point of return with regards to global warming miss the fundamental truth about seeking truth: we are almost certainly likely to have not yet uncovered the truth about our world that will fundamentally improve our model such that we can combat and potentially even reverse the global warming that has happened.

I understand not being sure when this will happen, but believing we won't uncover such a truth doesn't stem from humility as it may initially seem. When you believe we won't uncover a greater truth (for a given want) by searching for it assumes that it doesn't exist, which implies we know most of what we can know (for that want), which can easily be shown to be a deluded conclusion by looking at history.

Therefore, if you don't believe that a significantly greater truth exists that would change how we view global warming itself, leading to a path to reversing it, then it implies an overconfidence in what we've done so far.

The more humble (and more aligned with reality) approach is to acknowledge that there exists a more powerful truth that will enable us to reverse global warming, but have doubts over our ability to get there quickly enough.

And if you believe this, then, once again, you have no choice but to think about how to be better at seeking truth, and the better we are, the faster we will uncover the necessary truth.

The only question really is how quickly can we get there, not whether it exists or not.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle -> The Pareto principle seems to be one of the early mainstream understandings of this phenomenon (in modern times). It is a byproduct of the nature of seeking truth. While 80 / 20 might have been closer to reality in the past, technology will accelerate this towards 100 / 0.
(This is relevant to when we talk about the power law we find in the world).
-> Will really need to emphasize the importance of the power law - and how it is inversely proportional to our delusion.

As a species we are reducing our delusion about the world we live in so that we can get what we want: survival / self-sustenance. To be clear, we don't want happiness. (maybe this is too much of the truth for now).

To focus is about saying no, as Steve Jobs mentioned. But the most important thing to train yourself to say no to isn't just people / things in the external world tugging at you, but to all the wants that the mind produces when it predicts that you don't believe will help maximize getting what you want.

(There are absolutely many such wants).

Most wants are hidden in our subconscious. There are hidden nodes in the tree that are being optimized for without us even realizing that it's happening. And also, some wants appear to be one thing, but in reality are completely different.
