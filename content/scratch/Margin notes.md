You might ask what happens when we want multiple things at once. I believe the mind focuses on one want at a time, and the feeling that we can multi-task probably exists because we're not aware of the subtle umps between wants that the mind is always making - sometimes within a single second.

But even if you believe otherwise (that there are multiple "threads" so to speak), understanding how a single thread operates should still be useful.

And we've found in practice that the values of truths follow the power law: the most valuable truths are orders of magnitudes more valuable than the least valuable ones. (note: will definitely need to substantiate this more, OR better: let's move this beyond the tree search - possibly towards the end, when we draw conclusions - this is a VERY important point).

Can we simultaneously have multiple wants?

- Yes, the entire branch of wants is fulfilled. (but, this comes in the section )
- Yes, but we focus on seeking truth for one at a time.

(Keep the discussion re. the root cause really short. There's no need to dig into such philosophical talk - it's not necessary to drive home the point, and I don't think people would want to dwell on that in any way since it's terrifying).
