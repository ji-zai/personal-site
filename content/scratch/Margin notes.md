You might ask what happens when we want multiple things at once. I believe the mind focuses on one want at a time, and the feeling that we can multi-task probably exists because we're not aware of the subtle umps between wants that the mind is always making - sometimes within a single second.

But even if you believe otherwise (that there are multiple "threads" so to speak), understanding how a single thread operates should still be useful.
