A prediction leads to a sub want, and the process continues until you have the muscle memory required to execute your want without having to seek truth.

What determines when you can act on something and when you seek truth? It all depends on whether you have muscle memory for it or not. That's the "grounding" factor for seeking truth.

OK, let's come back to this concept. This is how this model is once again grounded in reality.

Muscle memory doesn't require attention. Seeking truth requires attention.

=> seeking truth for this particular want ends when muscle memory begins, giving space for another want to arise if need be.
