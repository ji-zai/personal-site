### Intro

### 1. Seeking truth

Truth & delusion
A truth has a notion of value
Values follow the power law
Wants have expectations
Acting on beliefs
A want leads to more wants
Seeking truth is a recursive search for higher value truths
Time is scarce
Satiation and the lack of it
The complexity of a want
Applying our model to any skill
There is an objectively “true” value for a truth
We blunder
How we blunder

### 2. Conditioning

Four functions of the mind

1. Observe
2. Understand
3. Value
4. Predict
   Conditioning
   Conditioning is felt
   Conditioning has a notion of depth
   Conditioning can be blinding
   Conditioning is a reaction to a stimulus
   Conditioning saves time
   Conditioning updates in response to satiation
   Intuition and bias are both conditioning
   The mind is fundamentally addictive

### 3. Factors of ability

Four factors of ability: conditioning, willpower, ability to act, memory.
Willpower is ability to resist conditioning
Memory is ability to recall beliefs as thoughts
Ability to act
A difference in conditioning
A difference in willpower
A difference in ability to act
A difference in memory
Interdependency

### 4. Stages of mastery

Four stages of mastery: novice, average, great, master.
Novice
Average
Great
Intuition vs. bias
Delusion compounds proportional to layers between you and reality.
Intuition vs. intellectual knowledge
Even greats become outdated

### 5. Change

Truths expire
Intuition becomes bias
Distribution of expiry rate: not all truths expire at the same rate.
Human progress accelerates rate of truth seeking
Our wants become more complex

### 6. Evolution

Nature seeks truth
Why we want what we want
Evolution of our minds (in terms of the four factors)
Nature's conditioning is somewhat outdated
Nature is hoping for an intelligence "take-off"

### 7. Mastery

Masters discern bias and intuition
Masters can control depth of their conditioning
How good can we get?
When will artificial intelligence surpass us?
Artifiicial intelligence "take-off".

### 8. Predictions

(These will need to be organized: there is a "right order" to follow here as one may be derived from another.)

- Equality vs. power law (towards extreme) - this is the first point.
  - Equality is a delusion (explain this point well)
- Acting vs. processing (no acting)
- Secrecy vs. transparency
- Hierarchical vs. flat organizations
  - We will also be tending towards equal compensation for all employees - and this is an interesting point that seems contradictory from the outside. But I think this is also true.
- Specialist vs. generalist.
- Competition vs. collaboration.
- Centralized vs. decentralized
- Scattered vs. focused
- Gradual progress vs. hit driven
- Credential based status (or credibility) vs. results based status.
- Understanding the universe vs. understanding the human condition.
  - Show how programmers evolve to understanding what people want.
  - The best chess players have graduated to creating content - i.e. solving for the human wants.
- Teaching truths vs. teaching seeking truth
  - In the past, individual truths were incredibly valuable. Hence our education system is more about communicating facts rather than training the process through which you can seek truth. As we approach the limit, the only education that matters will explain the human condition to a child (according to their age, teach them the minimal communication technique to transmit that information to their minds - whether that is English or not we'll see), protect them from themselves until their mind has matured (a rough heuristic could be 25 years - but most likely this will depend on the child) (i.e. protect them from harmful addictions that prevent them from seeking truth), and let them do whatever they want. Any other centralized, opinionate education will be sub-optimal.
- Low ambition to high ambition
- Low ego to high ego (this one is a bit problematic unless you really, really explain it).
- Short-term thinking to long-term thinking

### Concluding thoughts

Our purpose
We are accountable
The incentives always win. The laws of nature always win. Let’s figure out what they are to get what we want.

### Appendix?

- Our collective incentives as a species.
  - Define what a transaction is (4 qualities of a transaction).
  - Show why maximizing transactions is all a group of individuals cares about
