(note: show an elegant image showing the model in a mind, and the delusion existing outside of that mind as the gap between the mind and reality).

Delusion can only be understood in hindsight: after you've removed yourself of the delusion, you can better see how it existed in the past, and the nature of what it was (i.e. to what extent you were deluded about what things).

Your model gives you power. The more powerful your model is, the better you understand the systems that govern what you want in that moment, and the more you get of what you want, more quickly.

And the power of your model is the power of all of your truths - i.e. each row in this spreadsheet that we're using to represent the model:

Power of row = (value)(confidence)(1 - delusion).
The power of the model is the sum of the powers for each row.

Why this formula?

If you believe in a truth that is valuable (i.e. relevant to your want, and powerful), and you have high confidence in it, then you have greater power because you can predict more about the systems that govern your want, and therefore are more able to get what you want.

If you believe in a truth with low confidence, you have less power because you're less able to act on it as you're unsure whether it's actually true. The higher the cost of acting on it, the more you'll need to increase your confidence somehow before you can act on it.

(todo: give a good example here)

The (1 - delusion) exists as a penalty for being for being mis-aligned with reality. The more deluded you are, the less power you have.

If you have high confidence in your truth, but your truth isn't close to reality, then you'll have a more difficult time getting what you want.

A person that wants to build a bridge across a river that believes that gravity exerts no force on the bridge is extremely deluded and any bridge they build is likely to collapse as a result.

Therefore, seeking truth is to increase the power of your model so that you can get what you want more quickly.

And how would you do that?
1. Increase value.
2. Increase confidence.
3. Reduce delusion.

The way we've defined this model is inaccurate in some ways. As we explore the process in which this model gets updated, we'll be in a better position to improve it. For now it's directionally right in the sense that increasing value, confidence and decreasing delusion builds a more powerful model.

Delusion is a critical piece of this equation. Without taking delusion into account, anyone could simply believe their truth had higher value than it actually does, or increase their confidence in it randomly, leading to a more powerful model.

Unfortunately, there is a great penalty for delusion that makes this a difficult way to increase the power of your model.

To be clear, the power of your model has nothing to do with whether you can explain why you believe what you do. If it's truly high value, you have high confidence, with minimal delusion, you have a powerful model that will enable you to get what you want more quickly, and easily, regardless of whether you can explain it.

(note: some of the most successful people (in terms of being able to get what they want), would fail to explain well enough why they believe what they do about the world and themselves.)

For example, Ramanujan pulling profound theories from "God" that all happened to be right. He didn't even get around to proving most before he died. Those that simply have a feel for things, and that feel happens to be true. They may try to explain things after the fact, but that explanation is constructed, not what they actually used to have high skill.

We learn by observing, understanding, and predicting.

To observe is to consciously perceive something happening. You can perceive this through any of your senses: see, hear, taste, feel, smell, or thinking (i.e. observing a thought).

To understand is to update your model according to an observation. This update could involve changing a truth (i.e. the statement that represents a truth), changing your confidence in a truth, or changing how much you value a truth. And this update could impact multiple rows in your model.

To predict is to make guesses about truths that can't be directly inferred by what you've observed. 

These guesses are stored in your model just like any other truth. They simply differ in that they have lower confidence. After all, a guess with a high confidence isn't really a guess.

When you observe something, your mind starts trying to understand it. When you understand something (i.e. you've updated your model to reflect it), your mind starts to predict what else is likely to be true given this understanding.

The mind seems to operate in multiple ways to get to a prediction from understanding. Questions pop up that push you in that direction. You may feel some "intuition" that tugs at you to consciously form a hunch about the world. But regardless of the way to get there, we arrive at a prediction: a truth with some confidence, but not very high confidence because if it were, it wouldn't be a prediction. But whatever its operation is, it's your similarity function (referencing above).

And when you predict something to be true, and your mind believes it is high value (i.e. your value function returns a high value), then you'll want to see whether it's actually true, because if it is, you're model will become more powerful.

So, a prediction triggers another want. But, what triggers an observation? Does it come out of a void? I think it comes from a want.

When we want something, the mind is conditioned to try and notice the things that it believes will help it get what we want, to the degree of the intensity of our want.

For example, ().

This makes a cycle: want -> observe -> understand -> predict. And since we never stop wanting, we're constantly in this cycle.

This is the fundamental process of seeking truth in order to get what we want. Every one of us goes through this process. Some of it happens consciously, using some systematic method to go from one step to another, but I believe most of it happens unconsciously.

How does our model get updated through this cycle? Well, understanding an observation updates the model (adds, or edits row(s) in the model). And similarly, a prediction is also an update. Each prediction is simply another row, just with lower confidence than the truths that are directly derived from observations. When you update the model directly based on an observation, you're naturally have higher confidence in it than if you were predicting what is true.

Another way to look at this process, is that it's a search problem that has many branches. And each branch spawns more branches. It's recursive (link: wiki article).

You start with a want. The want leads to observations that your mind believes can help fulfill that want. Observations leads to understandings, which lead to predictions; predictions that your mind considers valuable become wants, each with its own sub-cycle. It goes on and on.

The mind focuses on one want at a time. The feeling that we can multi-task probably exists because we're not aware of the jumps between wants that the mind is always making - sometimes within a single second.

An interesting example is what I experienced just now: I was typing a word in the above paragraph, felt some hunger, wanted some food - all while not stopping the typing. And then my mind noticed a spelling mistake in my typing and my current want shifted to wanting to to fix it, leading me to hit backspaces and re-type.

Even in this small window of typing a word, my stomach growled, my mind wanted food, and then saw that I made a typo and then jumped back to wanting to fix it. I don't think those wants happened simultaneously. But if they didn't, how did my fingers keep typing while I was wanting something else other than to write the next word? I think because we can do things mindlessly without wanting, just how we can drive a car without actively, consciously wanting.

The presence of mindless action that is fulfilling a previous want doesn't disprove that the mind can only want one thing at a time. But even if you believe otherwise (that there are multiple "threads" so to speak), understanding how a single thread operates should at least be directionally illuminating.

When you want something, and you predict truths, the truths that you predict are an outcome of your similarity function, and which prediction is chosen to form the next want is an outcome of your value function: i.e. the highest value prediction is chosen to continue down the branch.

And so, your similarity function determines how many ideas you have, and your value function helps you prioritize: the highest value prediction forms the next want.

Remember, the value and similarity functions depend on what you want, and so does your model (the rows with all the truths you believe in). When your want changes, your functions and model are updated to reflect the values for the new want.

But, if this were all that existed, you'd just go down a single branch forever. What stops exploration down a branch?

Well, if you sufficiently get what you want from that want, you'll bounce back up to its parent: the want that led to this want. Let's call this process of being done with exploring in the current branch because a want is sufficiently fulfilled as "satiation".

There's clearly another factor to make you stop if you don't get what you want for an extended period of time, even if you're not satiated. Let's call this factor "patience".

Satiation and patience impact how deep we go down branches, and how we move to other wants when searching for the truths that help us get what we want.

(There's a beautiful animation here with a node having a "satiation" and "patience" bars - like pokemon HP, when either is full, it exits that node).

We saw above how our model (spreadsheet with each row as a truth) is updated when we understand, and predict. Similar to how our model is updated, our similarity and value functions are also updated.

Your confidence in a truth increases when you observe something that supports it. 

And the value you assign a truth increases when you get what we want, and you feel that this truth that you believed in is the cause - to the degree that you believe it was the cause and how much you liked what you got from it.

And your similarity and value functions update to reflect this: your mind will change to value truths more highly the more similar it feels they are to the truths that gave you what you want, and your mind will change to predict higher value truths.

The similarity function updates when the confidence and value of a truth changes. Why?

Our minds want to show us more relevant predictions that are higher value. So if the confidence and value of a truth increases, then the mind will want to make connections similar to the connection it made from the previous truth to this one (via prediction).

(todo: show this with an example).
(todo: this last part needs work. It feels off, I'm no longer sure it's true. There seems to be a simpler model here, and I'm going to find it.)
