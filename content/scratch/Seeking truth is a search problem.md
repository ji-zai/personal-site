I need to create the model here that accurately represents what's going on.

Want -> observe -> understand -> predict -> want.

*(note: keep the initial version of this theory quite simple. We will complicate the crap out of it just to show how non-straightforward it is in the "Everything changes" beat, but there's no need to start with that level of complexity. And in fact, this simplicity is actually quite aligned with the essence.)*

How does a want impact an observation? Why is an observation a reaction to a want? The more intense the want, the greater percentage of observations are relevant to that want (or rather, your mind thinks they are relevant and therefore shows them to you).

The predict() will lead to multiple predicted truths, which will then lead to a want to validate whether that prediction is true or not, leading to the next cycle one level down.

Your value function enables you to prioritize which "sub-want" to pick up and pursue.

The mind (conscious mind at least) seems to be a single threaded processor. When you're having one thought, you're not simultaneously having another thought. If you have another thought, it means you've left the previous thought.

This leads to an exploration of sub wants and their sub wants in a one-at-a-time manner.

**How long does this search last?**
1. Sufficient satiation. You got enough of what you want.
2. Sufficient agitation: Until you lose patience and believe that this path will not enable you to get what you want.
3. Sufficient fatigue: that you need to recover from.

This whole thing is bonkers I tell you. Lol...
