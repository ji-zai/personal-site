- Seeking truth only makes sense in the context of wanting something. No want = no seeking truth.
- We have an internal model for what we believe to be true. For now, we're representing this model with a spreadsheet with rows; each row corresponding to: { truth, confidence, value} where the truth is an English statement describing the belief, confidence is a number 0 - 1 that represents how confident you are in this truth, and its value (positive integer) represents how much your mind values this truth to help you get what you currently want.
- The value for a truth is tied to the current want. When the want changes, the values in the model are updated to reflect the new want.
- Delusion is the degree to which your model is mis-aligned with reality. The more delusion that exists in your model, the more wrong it is, and the less you are able to get what you want by following your model.
- When a want shows up, it comes with a fulfillment value: the value that the best truth for this want needs to have in order for this want to be satiated.
- When a want shows up:
	- If the best valued truth for the want suffices, and you know exactly how to act on it, you will simply act on it, to fulfill it.
	- If the best valued truth for the want suffices, but it doesn't have enough information to be acted on fully, then whatever can be acted on will be acted on, a child want is created to understand how to act on it, and truth seeking for that child want begins.
	- If the best valued truth for the want doesn't suffice to fulfill it, you will seek seek truth to find out a good enough truth that can fulfill the current want.
- There are 4 functions of the mind that comprise of the truth seeking process.
	- Observe: to perceive something through one of your senses.
	- Understand: to translate an observation in to statement that represents the truth you believe in.
	- Value: to assign a value to a truth based on how much it will enable you to get what you want.
	- Predict: to guess more truths based on what you already believe in.
- Each is a reaction to the previous: observe -> understand -> value -> predict.
- And the "observe" itself is a reaction to a want. What you want triggers the mind to start observing things that fulfill the want, and the cycle of seeking truth begins.
- Each function has an objective and subjective component to it. Two people with the same want, who have full understanding of all the systems that govern their want (without any delusion) will want the same exact observation, understanding, value, and prediction functions. Subjectivity only occurs based on degree of delusion and degree of difference in the want.
- As discussed above, when the best valued truth fulfills the want, and you don't know how to act on it, a child want is generated to understand how to act on it. This process of generating child wants that can have their own child wants turns this into a recursive tree search problem.
- A want rarely "ends" as expected, it only comes back with greater or lower fulfillment value by calibrating itself based on whether it has been satiated or not. If the want is satiated, it disappears temporarily and returns with a higher fulfillment value (i.e. is calibrated to have higher expectations this time around). When a want isn't fulfilled for an extended period of time it too temporarily disappears and returns with a lower fulfillment value (i.e. is calibrated to have lower expectations).
- This means a want has a notion of patience: how long it lasts before temporarily disappearing when it has not been fulfilled. This is the patience of the want, not your patience.
- Satiation occurs on the path to getting what you want - whenever you generate a child want and go deeper in the tree. In other words, whenever the mind finds a path to getting what it wants, it will generate some satiation.
- The mind updates based on satiation / lack of it. This update happens each moment.
- The update is nothing but conditioning the path that led to satiation, and de-conditioning the path the longer it goes without satiating. This conditioning impacts all the functions of the mind and model.
- And this is the process.
