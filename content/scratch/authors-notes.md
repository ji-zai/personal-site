OK, conditioning is the absolute crux of the essay. And it's the most difficult concept for me to communicate. I'm really struggling if I'm being honest with myself.

If I can write the section on conditioning well, I'm confident the rest of the essay will flow quite well. That's what it feels like to me right now anyway.

Head home and get the ink? I think I'll need it to seriously grind. Hmm... Yeah, this is something that I ought to flesh out on paper. It's going to be a ridiculous grind, but I want to have a solid understanding of conditioning by e.o.d today for sure. At least a foundation on which I can dive deeper in the coming days. I didn't expect that I'd have such a difficult time communicating it.

---

Do not fall into the trap of the outline! If you feel the need to explain something in conditioning, then do it there! Only later re-organize. Follow the more natural path of explanation without adhering to some predetermined outline that you want to stick to.

Your conditioning to follow an outline is incredibly strong. You must push back against it.

Some poeple undermine the power of AI by saying that all it does is predict the next token. I don't think they understand how the mind works becuase that's what we mostly do!

Intelligence is mistaken to be reasoning or logical thinking or rational thought, but as we've seen the conditioning is incredibly valuable and more valuable than what most people consider to be "intelligence".

Therefore I believe how we're building AI is directionally correct. Where we lag behind is in how much we can scale it. And it is far, far away from matching the complexity that human conditioning is able to represent. Classical computers will no be able to achieve it becuase they don't scale fast enough. We'll almost definitely require higher order compute infrastructure (quantum, beyond?) which is why I believe we'll have another AI winter, but shorter than our previous one.

## Predicting the next thing is possibly the most valuable human skill. Someone that is better at predicting but slower or worse at reasoning will likely perform much better than someone who can't even predict the right branches to go down, even if they have spectacular reasoning.

Where to discuss the value and similarity functions? - or in other words, how equality is a delusion. But as the complexity grows, equality becomes more rare. Once again use the example of Chess and Go to illustrate this.

## Actually, I'll absolutely need to discuss this in change. And only after I discuss this can I discuss skill right?

OK:

1. Intro
2. Seeking truth (includes the theory of a want)
3. Conditioning
4. Factors that determine skill
5. Stages of mastery
6. Change
7. Evolution
8. Predictions

Einstein's approach to communicate relativity was incredible. The way he breaks it down. How he starts with beliefs that the reader can easily agree with and then tears those beliefs apart.

The aligning to build trust and then ripping apart was so beautifully done.

DO NOT THINK ABOUT PREDICTIONS / HEURISTICS UNTIL YOU'VE WRITTEN THE ESSAY. SIT AND SPEND TIME ON PREDICTIONS ONCE YOU'VE FLESHED OUT YOUR UNDERSTANDING SUFFICIENTLY. AND ONCE YOU WRITE THEM, THEN GO BACK AND WRITE THE INTRO.

This is the way to go about it. Don't pigeonhole yourself into any particular prediction or approach. Take the broad, fundamental approach and then draw from it the most fundamental, important, impactful predictions you possibly can.

### The mind is single threaded (may want to eliminate this)

We focus on one thing at a time. Our consciousness can move from one thing to another, but cannot focus on multiple things simultaneously. If you don't believe this, well, our discussion will still be directionally useful: you'll just extrapolate what happens on one thread to multiple. But from my experience observing myself, and research has shown to some degree that it's likely we are single threaded.

The flow that I think works best:

1. Let them know the four factors that determines ability to seek truth.
2. Conditioning
3. Ability to act.
4. Memory: explaining feelings.
5. Willpower

Therefore, in order to train ability to seek truth, we train all of these factors. But, they are not made equal. To understand why, we need to understand how the world is changing.

...

OK, so there's a clear set of priorities here on what to train.

The game that we're all playing is clearer.

Now, I think there is great advice here that is possible to enable us to seek truth more effectively in this new world. A wise person will deploy everything they can to prevent themselves from holding themselves back. And it truly is a collaborative effort: you need the world's help to stop you from holding yourself back.

I believe the following heuristics will help us navigate this rapidly changing world more effectively to get what we want.

A quick note on how all heuristics are bound to be eventually misinterpreted. There is absolutely no way around this, but I believe the following will remain true for as far as I can see (up to having AGI at the level of human intelligence. Beyond that who the fuck knows).

There are immediately applicable heuristics that I'll leave you with.

Immediate

1. Thinking vs. acting: Think more than you think you should.
2. Ignore pay-to-learn education. Only trade equity for education.
3. Do not join any company as an employee.

- The opportunity cost between joining company and starting

4. Do not join any team that has any standardized test to assess ability.
5. Start much younger than you think you should. Dropping out of the average high school is the right move today. Until the education system shift significantly, you will simply condition your mind in ways that will be tough to decondition. This comes with difficulties:
6. Seek the power law in everything. Equality is a delusion.
7. Life is a single player game
8. Ignore specific advice according to the difficulty of the want, and rate of change of truths for that want.
9.

When GPT-5 comes out + 2 years:

1. Do not join any company as a cofounder if the company has even one employee or plans to have employees in the future.
2.

Everything stems from the nature of conditioning, how it's important and why the nature of conditioning determines everything about humans. Writing this part will literally write the rest of the essay. Amen.

---

The nature of conditioning and truth makes seeking truth incredibly difficult because:

1. Our minds are wired to become addicted.
2. We cannot communicate conditioning to another human being. All we can say is what to do to best develop the right conditioning. This means education and training is incredibly difficult, and takes time - the time it takes to condition.

(All of us know our education is outdated, but the usual explanation. It's not that what we're learning is outdated - even though it is, but it's that the entire system is not set up to test conditioning. Anything you can have a standardized test for does not test conditioning). Or rather, any test that you can prepare for by intellectual understanding will fail to test conditioning. This is also why a standardized test for any job will no longer work because we will increasingly need to test for conditioning, not for intellectual understanding. And the best way to test for conditioning for any domain is to see if they've already done great work in that domain, anything else is a bet - and a bet that will follow the power law. Does that sound familiar? It's the meme about how you need experience to get a job in order to get experience. Another paradox.

And importantly, the faster the world changes, the more difficult it is for us to be great at seeking truth. But the ones that are better will be much, much better as a result of a faster changing world.

And this is the paradox of our times. ("Paradox" requires its own piece).

I want to completely cut out the novice becoming a master for a particular skill story nonsense. That can come later when this essay is expanded perhaps, but I need to keep things as fucking tight as I can possibly keep them. This is critical. Don't let the path slip. Writing a good essay is as difficult as walking a razor's edge.

---

People generally undervalue conditioning and overvalue intellectual understanding. This often leads us to incorrect conclusions. For example, a person with the right conditioning is invaluable. A company led by someone with the right conditioning will perform orders of magnitude greater than a company led by someone with slightly less valuable conditioning.

Therefore CEO compensations at the best companies are likely far below the true market value of their skill.

---

The more I write, the more value I see in putting your beliefs about a section up front in the strongest, most precise way you possibly can - so that you create the curiosity to understand why I believe that. There is no such thing as natural curiosity - it only exists if it is related to getting what you want. Therefore, I have two tasks: 1. Show them why they should want to understand this, and then to make the claims that, if true, will impact how they go about getting what they want, and therefore they are now curious to see why I believe what I believe, and what that means for how they go about getting what they want.

I'm also realizing that I really ought to go chronologically. It's only when you go chronologically that the right train of thought / flow arise. For example, right now I'm seeing a much, much better way to approach the "skill" section - by tying everything back to the blunders, but simply explaining how with the new theory of mind.

Every single thing needs to point back at the blunders - because that is the origin of the desire to dig deeper.

### Thinking vs. feeling

Understanding happens at a level below thinking. Of course, after the understanding happens, our minds naturally form thoughts about it, and often our thoughts are in the form of language. But even before language was invented, even in the days of cavepeople, they understood things such as sticking your hand in fire will burn you.

---

A really interesting feedback soliciting experience came to mind: essentially a way to grab user feedback as they read the essay. Let the do it at their own pace and time, perhaps even spread across a few days if they'd like. Give them the flexibility. But, be really good about capturing the essence of their feedback. Anyways, need to think this through.

Another approach could be to release it piece by piece. That would be interesting as well... One piece at a time, and get their thoughts on it.

Anyways, will get there when I get there. Amen.

Where to talk about how words are interpreted differently due to different conditioning.

Also: the point about what AI will take over first and how it will progress - will be an entirely different essay. That doesn't need to go here at all. They are good points, but

A great way to show outdated intuition is like riding a bike with after flipping the direction in which the handlebar steers (move it left and you actually go right instead of left!). This is a great way to see just how uncomfortabe it is for the reality to change and our intuition become bias. And it's also great to see just how difficult it is to retrain the mind to operate it according to its new mechanics.

And -> you can also use this to show how a child who only learned how to ride a bike a few months ago will likely do much better than someone who's been riding a bike for years - because they have less conditioning to override.

The master, on the other hand, would be able to adapt their riding to the new mechanism faster than most, and perhaps even faster than the child who only learned a few months ago.

This single example illustrates intuition vs. bias and how change feels almost perfectly.

_On reading as the example to show conditioning vs. memory_

Something about: even while reading this essay you’re observing the sequence of words, understanding it, valuing what you understood - if the value is too low, you’ll probably stop reading it, and predicting what this means for your life. Well, I give myself too much credit, you’d only value and predict if what you’re reading changes how you see the world in some way.

And therefore reading is also a form of conditioning. This is why it’s completely alright to forget what you’ve read because the point is that the way you see, understand, value, predict have already been impacted by what you read. You don’t need to be able to recall the details for your conditioning to have been impacted. This is how conditioning differs from memory. → this is the perfect example to show this difference.

But of course, the kind and depth of conditioning depends on how you read. Someone who skims a book very quickly will condition themselves less than someone who really tries to understand - re-reading the parts that they don’t feel like they fully understand, if imagining how this applies to their lives, etc. For many kinds of writing, slower readers are better off since they condition their minds more deeply.

[Predictions](https://www.notion.so/Predictions-7048f52e95a54639b0c4e0a30c6d8df8?pvs=21)

---

So, where do these predictions go?

Also, there are many “punch” dialogues in this that I’ll need to solidify. They would be incredible tweets / short essays that I ought to utilize for growth.

---

OK, there is a powerful perspective here: since all the levels are the exact same, you can tell someone skill in a lower depth of the tree by seeing their behavior at the higher layers of the tree. At any given moment there is one priority that is orders of magnitude greater than the others, then it ought to apply to every node in the tree. Those that have a greater “work/life” balance, unless their external circumstances absolutely requires it, likely mis-prioritize in similar ways at lower rungs of the tree.

It’s not a surprise to me how obsessed the best are to achieve anything they want. Including happiness! The happiest recorded person spends most of their time honing the skill of happiness. And a skill it is! Sama quote on how the most effective people have at most 2 things going on in their lives.

This isn’t to say they don’t spend time at all with their families, but when they prioritize their family,

How much time to spend predicting paths depends on the complexity of the want, and the leverage available to you.

The optimal approach looks incredibly lopsided at any given moment in time. Just how balance

We want to be great period. Not great at some particular thing. If someone was a great chess player, but only 2 people in the entire world played: them and their grandmother who was about to die, they’d simply not continue playing. They’d pick another game that they’re similarly good at, that has a much larger audience, and dedicate themselves to that.

We are off by an order of magnitude for everything. And as our technology becomes more powerful / our leverage increases, we will soon be multiple orders of magnitude off.

- **Optimal looks incredibly lopsided**. (likely an order of magnitude greater than what we have now). - and if they can’t sustain it, that’s valuable evidence that they need to seek truth about what form of expression they can sustain lopsided - because that is likely the one they are well conditioned to do. So pushing for lopsided actually shows you your delusion more quickly, and pretending that you want two things equally only masks just how far off you are.
  - Equality good paths is a delusion.
- **We are an order of magnitude off how much we seek truth vs. act**. Seeking vs. acting depends on the complexity of the want, and leverage available. And duration of continuous time dedicated to one direction also depends on complexity and leverage available. There really is something here to explore and clearly define.
- **We are slow to quit by an order of magnitude**. I.e. if we work on something for a year before we quit, it likely means that we had sufficient evidence after the first month, but we failed to seek truth effectively (likely by rushing to act, and because we are addicted to the momentum that comes with it). And this truth actually delays quitting because by quitting you admit that you failed to quit earlier. (our outdated conditioning pushes us to hold onto the path).
- **We quit an order of magnitude too quickly.** And this is precisely why more time spent seeking truth and understanding is required, because if you don’t study what evidence you’ve received well enough, you’re going to blunder.
- **Copying the speed of the master without their conditioning is a gross miscalculation.** If someone comes and makes a decision incredibly quickly, and you believe that is the best speed to make it, then you’ve missed understanding the difference in your conditionings.
- **The same mind applies everywhere. Skill at one level, determines skill at all levels.**
  - This means that if you are slow to quit, slow to adjust seek truth vs. act, or are not lopsided at the top level (how you prioritize life itself), you are likely similarly terrible at wants at lower levels of depth.
  - E.g. you spend your time juggling multiple activities, functions, etc. and if you’re a CEO I predict that your product line is just as overly complicated as your life is. If you’re slow to break up with a clearly mis-aligned relationship, you will be similarly slow to fire someone. If you have a tendency to make friends / partners who you later realize weren’t great friends, the same skill translates to how you hire.
  - If you do not become great at anything within a certain amount of time, you will die being great at nothing - including being happy.
  - Becoming great at one thing translates a lot more to other things than we expect. Kobe Bryant and business.
  - Therefore there isn’t a trade-off in the way people think there is.
  - Similarly, those that have great big picture ideas are also capable of having great small-picture ideas. I’d bet, and my experience interacting with those I consider great backs this up: that the ones with the most interesting product design ideas, tend to have the interesting business ideas, tend to have interesting ways to live life.
  - This tendency that the patterns in one layer apply to others is an incredibly valuable tool to gauge who the right people to work with are - which I’ll dive quite deep into in a later essay since it’s a critical part of becoming great at seeking truth. (i.e. being careful about who you collaborate with, and how to collaborate).
  - This is why the greatest artists, scientists, and entrepreneurs, chess players, etc. have more in common with each other, than they do with the rest of us. (this is incredibly important).
- **There is an age beyond which it’s reasonable to bet that a person will never become great at anything in their lives.**
  - I predict that age is decreasing quickly. And I predict that today that age is somewhere between 20 - 30. If you don’t see signs of being great by then (at any skill), I don’t think they will ever be great at what they do. There will be exceptions, but let’s not assume we are. In fact, I predict that most people that think they are the exception are likely not - because the exceptions will need a paranoia that those who believe they are the exceptions clearly don’t have.
  - The bar for greatness is rising. In the context of business, by great I mean the next set of multi-trillion dollar companies. In science I mean the next breakthrough discovery that shatters our understanding of our universe. In arts I mean the work of art that shakes us to the core and transforms our lives (I hope you’ve experienced such art before). That’s what I’m talking about. The extreme outcomes. As the bar for greatness rises, it will be tempting to provide counterexamples for things that we previously great. For example you may say there’s a rise in the number of billion dollar companies founded by those in their 40’s. That’s bound to happen in the same way the number of small businesses started by older people would have risen in previous generations.
    - And as a note: I believe this also applies to happiness. Someone unhappy for 40 years of their lives running from one thing to the other without finding peace, will find it very difficult to achieve great happiness in the later parts of their lives partly because they’ve conditioned their minds to be unhappy for so long. This isn’t to say they won’t be happy, but the point is that they ought to double down and prioritize seeking truth for it. If they do so they will likely uncover truths about what puts them at greater peace and what doesn’t and they can train their conditioning to observe, understand, value, and predict such that they work towards greater happiness. It’s those that think that they’ll just be happy sometime in the future when the have a billion dollars that completely misunderstood the game.
    - And if you think you’re happy, then I think you’re deluded about what kind of happiness (or peace, or whatever word you use) a human being is capable of experiencing, in exactly the same way that if you think you’re a great entrepreneur or scientist or artist you’re deluded about just how much you don’t know and how much you can improve. Let’s not think we’re deluded about everything except happiness for some reason especially when happiness is something that nature hasn’t even evolved us to have.
      - And objectively speaking, I think your brain readings would be incredibly far from the happiest person on earth, **or even your grandma for that matter**!
  - This is of course time dependent. 100 years ago I’d bet that the average age for greatness to show would be somewhere in 30s - 60s. That age is decreasing as a result of a more rapidly changing world and greater leverage. The exceptions to the rule will decrease.
- **We miscalculate risk because we don’t directly assess the conditioning that is formed by sub-optimal experiences.**

There is a saying in my mother tongue: “The wise and the insane look alike.”. Through the process of studying this I’ve come to see why this is the case. We look at masters like they’re crazy or stupid for living such a lopsided life. Yet, the master knows with wisdom that it’s the optimal strategy. We think the masters are stupid for forming beliefs with very little evidence, yet the masters know that speed to belief is critical and that they’d rather pick up a belief quickly

_Equality is a delusion_

_This either is a separate essay, or it may have to be clubbed in with the way the Novice sucks._

---

Don’t worry about examples unless absolutely necessary. Those can come later. Get the foundation down. And get the flow to be good. That’s all that’s required right now.

---

The audience? Myself for now. Don’t worry about the world just yet. Clarify your thinking about what the most important skill is. It’s really that simple. Only after you have the clarity, THEN think about how to get this in front of those that seek truth - from the perspective of getting high quality feedback.

---

_A good example of conditioning._

---

_Evolution can be modeled as nature’s truth seeking for the want to maximize life in the universe._

Satiation occurs when there is more life.

Each mutation is a prediction. And just like how deluded we are in our truth seeking, so is nature. It makes mistakes. Many predictions turn out to not be that great and don’t survive the conditions of the universe for long.

But, then it has a breakthrough, it uncovers a truth (a mutation) that satiates it better, and it doubles down on that to create more mutations in that direction.

In terms of the individual, we can feel nature’s truth seeking process in the form of the conditioning that we are born with.

If maximizing life is the want, it means that whatever we are made up of is optimized to maximize life: i.e. to survive and reproduce.

Nothing in evolution conditions us to want to be happy. We think happiness

_The power law is everywhere_

- Values of truths also follow the power law
- ***

  _The average remain average_

The longer the average remain average, the more biased conditioning is built up. The longer conditioning is built up, the deeper it becomes, and will require extraordinary effort to reverse - if it’s even possible to do so.

Therefore, the average if they remain average beyond a certain duration (”forever average duration”), will likely remain average for the rest of their lives.

The “forever average duration” of course depends on the individual, but the more interesting question is how is this duration is changing. Due to the exponentially increasing change in the world, and therefore exponentially faster rate of truths expiring, the “forever average duration” is incredibly small.

---

Hold off on the world commentary about the middle class disappearing, etc. That’s not at all required for this essay. Keep the scope tight.

https://jsomers.net/blog/gettiers → Interesting philosophical concept around what it means to know something.

Even in regulated industries, the power law exists, but the compensation doesn’t match the results due to regulation. Now, how much regulation is good, and how much pollutes incentives is a different story altogether.

---

Perhaps this is why great truth seekers of the past considered themselves compilers of knowledge, or claimed to have re-discovered something that someone previously had already discovered.

When seeking truth you will inevitably run into truths that others have discovered as well - it’s highly unlikely that you are the first. And therefore, there is no sense in taking credit for truth seeking. I wouldn’t have had these stream of thoughts without many, many influences that have shaped my conditioning with which I operate.

There is no sense of ownership. Do with this what you want.

---

The mind will make the jump from “I’m voting for X” to “I am X” without you even realizing. The mind wants to latch onto things quickly and fiercely. Countering this tendency isn’t as easy as it may seem at first glance.

---

We fail to see reality as it is. → feels quite important to reference in this essay.

---

When to talk about the information consumed? Perhaps that can be touched on in the “life is a single player game” essay / piece. → Yes!

Why even discuss the external factors right here? Wouldn’t that be better when discussing the power law?

---

I like the reference to this as a “tree”. I’d like to keep using this framing as a tree throughout the essay.

---

Even if you write in just bullet points for now, that’s also OK! Don’t worry about it right now. I want you to condense the essence of what you’re trying to get across in the simplest, most concise way possible for now. Will think about how to morph this into an engaging, compelling story later.

Each way of representing it is useful. And you might throw this out entirely when you discover a better representation of this! Accept, and embrace, the change that will inevitably come to this.

Free your mind from the worries of “getting this draft right”. Don’t worry. Just write. Just let it flow. The rest will take care of itself.

---

Why are you digging into the power law so up high? It doesn’t quite make sense to me. It feels… off..

I don’t think I need it. This can be a separate essay. I’m going to leave it out for now, can revisit it later to see if it needs to be in this essay. Good call. I could feel the attachment to something that doesn’t need to be in this essay.

---

OK, decided, going to represent this as a stream of consciousness. Whenever I feel that I don’t have a good enough grasp of what I’m trying to say, I’m going to open up an individual doc to explore it in depth, and then I’ll come back to the consciousness and rewrite it from scratch - with an emphasis on fitting the flow.

Damn, the organization of the notes really impacts ability to write. Or rather: your writing fits the organization, not the ohter way around. If you write one continuous flow, then the mind ensures that the flow is great. If you write in “chapters” and chunks, the mind will think in chapters and chunks, and fail to see the connections between different pieces as well as it should.

---

PG’s essays have that continuous flow vibe, because that’s how he writes! And I now see the value of writing like that. Powerful.

Should I invest in changing the organization so that the ideas flow better? Perhaps. Try it for a single section first to see how it feels. Amen.

Actually fuck it, you need this. A reason that’s been adding to my un-motivatedness is this feeling that I’m just writing to check off a box (i.e. finished xyz chapter). It started to feel like some school assignment rather than something that I couldn’t stop myself from doing. I think the re-org is important so that I can see the flow of things. The flow of one topic to the next helps me understand the purpose of why I’m even going down a particular sub-tree of exploration. Without that context I’m basically just doing a class assignment. Damn. This is a good learning. Do whatever in your power to not make this feel like some class assignemtn. Amen.

By having each chapter as its own “standalone file” kills the ability to see things as a continuous flow. In fact, the way you write will be how you
