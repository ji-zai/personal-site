### We blunder

Now that we have a model for what seeking truth is and have established a notion of objectivity, we can bring clarity to all the ways we blunder. Understanding how we blunder shows us where our potential for improvement is.

What is a blunder? We can only define blunder in terms of time because time is our only scarcity. Blunder is something we do that overly delays our ability to get what we want - i.e. to uncover higher valued truths. Some blunders are more costly than others. For example, someone who only always explores only the first prediction they have, will likely not only delay their ability to uncover high valued truths, but will never even uncover them before they die.

And naturally, more problematic than an individual blunder is consistently making blunders.

The first category of blunders stem from not knowing what we don't know. Given the information we've been exposed to, we are guaranteed to make mistakes that the all knowing being wouldn't make. And there is no way for us to not make such mistakes.

Of course a good truth seeker would work hard to minimize this gap. But even if you were to learn about all the truths that all humans have collectively uncovered for the history of humanity, there would still be a massive gap between us and the hypothetical all knowing being. And this gap naturally translates to massive blunders. Blunders we can do nothing about.

I suspect this gap is massive: that we have barely scratched the surface of all there is to know in the universe. Therefore, even the best human truth seeker will make many, many blunders that they will realize in hindsight as they learn more about the world.

If those great at what they do published all of their thinking and notes, it would be clear just how many misteps, backtracking, adjusting, etc. that takes place. It's not possible to be at the frontier of any skill without committing many blunders due to how little we know.

The corrollary is also important: if we are not blundering much in our exploration, it probably means that we're not pushing the boundaries of human understanding and capacity.

But, this is an incredibly dangerous belief because it leads to laziness. We'd develop a tendency to disown our blunders and pat ourselves on the back thinking we're pushing the boundaries whereas in reality we're just blundering due to stupidity that is entirely in our control to change.

But not acknowledging that masters will also blunder massively paints an unrealistic expectation of what mastery looks like, and so as someone seeking truth about seeking truth, I can't not acknowledge this fundamental truth about mastery.

**Therefore the goal is not to not blunder, but to not blunder in ways that we can avoid.**

Unlike most of us, the master is obsessed with discerning which blunders are the result of their lack in skill, and which blunders were inevitable. They know that this miscalculation is biggest blunder of them all.

### How do we blunder?

Accoridng to our model of seeking truth as a search problem represented by a tree of possibilities, our blunders look like the following:

1. We assign a value to a truth that is lower than it should be, leading us to ignore a valuable path.
2. We assign a value to a truth that is higher than it should be, leading us down a path that isn’t nearly as fruitful as another.
3. We quit a branch too soon.
4. We don’t quit a branch soon enough.
5. We act too soon, without giving ourselves time to predict, thereby seeing less possible paths and missing the best ones.
6. We take too long to act, and spend too much time thinking and predicting beyond a necessary point that won’t improve the paths available to us.
7. We don’t spend as much time as we could to seeking truth.

What’s clear is that there are tradeoffs for everything except for one thing: how much time we spend seeking truth to get what we want. That if you find a way to commit more time to seeking truth for a particular want, you will get better at fulfilling that want.

For the others, there is a tradeoff, and a tradeoff implies there’s an optimal point. And the answer to what that optimal point is, is of course “it depends”. But what does it depend on? And are the factors on which it depends on changing? If so, how does the change in factors impact how the optimal point shifts?

In order to be able to draw valuable conclusions and make predictions that actually help us become better at seeking truth and getting what we want, we need to dig much deeper to better understand why we commit these blunders.

Our model so far helps us see how we fall short, but it raises many questions. In order to answer these questions and to delve deeper into understanding exactly how we blunder and what we can do to improve, we need to study how the mind works. We need a theory of mind.

By theory of mind I mean a model of the functions of the mind and how it operates.
