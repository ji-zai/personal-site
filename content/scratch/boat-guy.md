## On seeking truth

Using the example of someone wanting to transport his family a few miles down the river because they don't have enough of a food supply where they are.

This is a far better example than the f(x) system. Fuck that overly theoretical nonsense. It doesn't vibe with me and it's unintuitive.

Why am I struggling to explain something that feels so obvious? It means that I don't understand it as well as I should. Bridging this gap b/w intuition and explanation is where my learning lies. Amen.

The process of seeking truth:
- List of truths you've uncovered about the systems that govern this want, each with its own confidence, and power.
- When you observe something that reinforces any truths you have, you update the confidence of those truths.
- You start to predict things.
