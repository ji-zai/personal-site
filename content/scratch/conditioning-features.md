### What am I going to talk about re. conditioning?

-> Conditioning = 4 functions.
-> You can feel conditioning as a pull (involuntary / instinctive)
-> Conditioning updates according to satiation
-> Conditioning has a notion of magnitude (the greater its magnitude, the stronger its pull, and the more subconscious it is, and the longer it takes to de-condition it)
-> Conditioning is addiction
-> Conditioning has a useful purpose
-> Conditioning is a response to a stimuli. (one such stimuli is a want)
