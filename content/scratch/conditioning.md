### Conditioning

I believe all of these functions are interconnected. In other words, a change in one function likely implies a change in every other function. A change in how the mind observes likely implies a change in how it understands, values, and predicts as well.

We've all had experiences that illustrate this interconnectedness. For example, as you seek truth about a topic and give yourself the time and space to ask probing questions (i.e. put effort into making more and different predictions), you would have noticed that your mind starts to observe things related to your research wherever you look. That your conversations seem to more quickly bend in the direction of your research. That your priorities change

Due to the interconnectedness, I'm going to refer to all 4 functions as conditioning. As we cover more features of conditioning, I hope it'll become clear why this is the most appropriate word to describe the state of these functions of the mind.

Conditioning manifests as a feeling. A "pull" towards a particular direction. It is instinctive. It is not active thinking.
