## On conditioning

If the entire explanation for why we are terrible at seeking truth had to be boiled down to one concept, that would be conditioning.

Conditioning is an instinctive response to a stimuli. It is not an active thought, but rather a feeling, a “tug” in a particular direction. Each of us are conditioned in various ways to various stimuli. One such stimuli is a want.

Conditioning isn’t restricted to humans. We see conditioning in every living organism that reacts to the external world in some way. A plant is conditioned to grow towards sunlight. A lizard is conditioned to chase insects and run away from fire. While we share much of the conditioning from other species that we’ve evolved from. We’re also capable of being conditioned in more complex ways as we’ll see. It seems to me that conditioning is one of the earlier mechanisms developed on our evolutionary journey towards becoming homo sapiens.

I believe we don't give conditioning as much importance as it deserves. I sure didn't for much of my life, and I probably still don't.

(note: the transition to deep dive: what do I mean by “direction”, what do I mean by “feeling”, and how does this “tug” feel?)
