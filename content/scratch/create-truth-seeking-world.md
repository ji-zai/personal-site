*This is the next essay; a natural follow-up to the first essay - once I show that truth seeking is all that remains, it's only natural to see how to create a more truth seeking world*

Prev essay overview
- Summarize first essay: seeking truth is the most important skill in the world today, and soon, it will be the only skill that remains (read the first essay if you haven't, this essay builds on top of it.)
- Quick definitions and overview of what it means to seek truth, and some properties of truth seeking that I'm going to reference in this essay (and write this intro overview after writing the entire essay because only then will you know what needs to be in it).

Individual
- It all starts with the individual. What does it take to train a mind to be more truth seeking?

Team
- 

World
- How we allocate resources.
- Credentials no longer play an important role in identifying talent.
- Remove all unnecessary gate-keeping to seeking the truth that you want. Basically remove all friction for seeking truth (and there are many!!!).
- Don't teach anything beyond first principles. Let people follow natural inclination (minus the addiction of consumption: of substance or content. Need to be very careful here because in a world of abundance, natural inclination is often a straight path to addiction).
- Equality of opportunity without equality of outcomes (the latter goes against )
- A company is the most powerful truth seeking vehicle, even more so than academia - by far. What keeps academia in the picture is that they can tackle problems that may only show results on an extremely long time horizon. But that can be fixed for companies  (potentially - need to see how).
- Don't create any artificial boundaries to seeking truth:
	- It can be an intense process, let the people who seek truth intensely, seek truth that way. (e.g. if you make it illegal to work more than 4 days a week for any employee, you will only speed up truth seekers arriving on the optimal execution. They will first leave your country, and they will have to find a way to work hard on what they want).
- Over-competition holds back seeking truth because it curbs ambition too much. Way too much.
