Thinking through from change -> evolution -> mastery -> predictions.

By this point we understand:

- The model of seeking truth, with the ability to see how any skill can be modeled this way.
- Conditioning: to ground the model in the mind.
- All of the factors that determine your ability to seek truth, given the state of these factors, and the state of the world the individual is in, we can determine how well they'd be at seeking truth in the moment. Of course, they can improve, or deterioriate - that is up to them.
- Stages of mastery => we have a better intuition for what different stages of this skill look like in terms of the factors - using real world examples that we're familiar with.

So by this we know what the skill is, the factors that determine our skill, and why and how we are terrible at it, and what the stages of mastery looks like.

But, we can't study any skill without understanding how the world is changing.

- Change and its impact on our ability.
- What we are born with.
