How does prediction trigger observations?

When you predict a truth, you'll want to test it out. Testing it out is nothing but observing the phenomena that validates (or invalidates) what you think is true. This is often done through an experiment.

But that's not all that can trigger an observation. What you want influences what you observe as well.

Even without predicting, as soon as you want something, your mind starts working to observe the things that it thinks will help you get what you want.

And not only does your want influence your observation, it also influences what you predict and how you understand. You will likely only predict the truths that you value (i.e. that you believe will help you get what you want).

After all, this only makes sense since this entire process works to maximize the power of your model (as we discussed above), and your model is only powerful if it helps you get what you want.

Time is a scarcity and therefore anything that takes time uses the most valuable resource you have. There is a cost to each step of the process.

Which means there's a factor of "patience" that determines how long you can stick to a step before moving on. I.e. how long you spend understanding, observing, predicting.

The greater the cost of the observation, the greater the time spent on understanding and predicting because you want to make sure that the experiment you design validates the most valuable prediction possible, such that your model becomes more powerful, more quickly.

Often, external circumstances create pressure to speed things up that makes time even scarcer. If you're being chased by a tiger, you have no time to validate your hunches about how to successfully escape, you're just going to do something or the other.

There's also an internal aspect to patience: the longer it takes to get what you want, the more agitated you become. It's this nature of the mind that makes you want to get what you want as quickly as possible. And this is often the determining factor for when you stop at a step and move on.

But, this isn't entirely true. Rather than "the longer it takes to get what you want", the more appropriate phrase is "the longer it takes to get the next hit of what you want". The former makes it sound like you don't get what you want until you've trained your model sufficiently, and that only when you act on the model you've trained, can you go get what you want.

In reality, training your model requires you to act - in order to validate a prediction. This means that as you train your model, you will likely get what you want, and once you do, your want morphs to want better versions of what you got, in greater magnitude, more quickly.

This is the cycle that keeps pushing us to want better and better things. It's only when a want is fulfilled does it transform to wanting better things. This applies to learning as well: you want to understand a simple system, and once you understand it, you will naturally want to understand more complex systems.
