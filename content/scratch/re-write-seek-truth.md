**What is truth?**
1. What is truth?
2. Why seek truth?
3. A truth has value. - value(t) -> int
4. Truths are clustered. - similarity(t1, t2) -> int
5. We have a model of what we believe is true.
6. We improve our model by observing, understanding, predicting.
7. What we want influences what we observe.
8. Seeking truth is a search problem.
9. It's a messy process (Everything changes, every moment).
