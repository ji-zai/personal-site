The incentives that govern humanity promise a bright future if we can manage to work in accordance with them. It is a skill that most of us suck at.

Seeking truth enables us to understand the incentives of any system, so that we can get what we want out of them.

Seeking truth is the most important skill today. Soon, it will be the only skill.

In this book I’ve attempted to study the world from first principles to explain why.

### Incentives that govern us

The incentives that govern humanity promise a bright future for our species if we can manage to work in accordance with them.

The individual human mind wants things, wants what it wants as quickly as possible, and wants more intensely the things it keeps getting.

The nature of the individual mind, when interacting with other individuals with the same nature creates incentives that govern our collective existence: **maximizing transactions between humans in both quantity and magnitude.**

No revolution can stop these incentives (without ending our species) given enough time because the craving to end maximizing transactions is itself a craving, which is the cause for the incentives. It doesn’t change the criteria the incentives depend on.

The incentives show how we got here, and where we are going.

I theorize that the incentives that govern us (maximizing transactions) also dictate the very wants we have, which explains why our culture evolved the way it did to get here, and what cultures will dominate the future.

Technology is amplifying the power of the incentives that govern us - which makes it exponentially more difficult to swim against the current of the incentives. For example, in sufficient time there won’t even be a possibility for a dictator in our world.

### **The incentives paint the following picture of the future:**

1. No limit on population.
2. No limit on health and lifespan. (depends on laws of nature, not people incentives).
3. No room for any skill other than seeking truth.
4. No wars - collaboration is better to maximize transactions than killing / making someone else poor.
5. Universal basic income that will increase faster than expenditures.
6. Best possible education for every human child.
7. A “religion” that predominantly centers around seeking truth → because that is the most direct optimization of the incentives, by definition. Which removes room for any dogmatic religion. People might use a different label to call it, but I believe it has no choice but to be grounded in truth seeking as defined in this book).

**For things that have trade-offs** (”sufficient” describes the point at which there is an equilibrium)

1. Sufficient craving to buy and create (the incentives don’t want the craving to be so less that you buy and create less things, but it doesn’t want you to be too stressed because then you can’t reproduce. The balance will be struck to maximize transactions. I predict this is actually less stress than we see today.).
2. Sufficient envy. People need to get worked up over what someone else has so that they do something to earn it. And the things that most people will want, will be unaffordable by UBI.
3. Sufficient decentralization (far more than we have today. If we have a world “leader” they will be comically weak).
4. Sufficient paranoia (so that we keep seeking truth on how to keep our species alive ⇒ maximizing transactions).
5. Sufficiently homogenous (far more than today with enough variation to enable transactions. Likely no / minimal borders, one primary language that binds the world ⇒ maximizing transactions).
6. Sufficient individual freedoms (More ways to express yourself, more ideas ⇒ maximizing transactions)
7. Equal opportunity with extremely unequal outcomes. (There is no practical way around this as this is the only way to maximize transactions. By creating equality of outcomes you will kill most transactions).

### Theory of mind

The mind is far more nuanced than we believe. I propose a theory of mind that divides the mind into 3 areas as I believe this is more aligned with the reality of the mind.

1. Thinking (language and imagination - audial, visual).
2. Feeling (sensations in the body).
3. Mental balance.

With this theory I explain that not all truth seeking is the same. AI will be incredibly powerful, very quickly, in the realm of thinking because I believe the complexity of our thinking will be eventually be matched by quantum computers, if not our current boolean based computers with sufficient scaling.

But, I predict AI will significantly lag behind in the realm of feeling because the complexity of feeling has a theoretical upper bound of the complexity of our world, and therefore, if AI can match us in the realm of feeling, then it implies that AI can simulate the world we live in. I predict we’re quite far away from that even with quantum computers, and that it’s too premature to think it through as it becomes a purely philosophical debate which I have no interest in.

### The only path I see

Therefore, given the incentives of the world, and the nature of our minds, the only path I see is to build a truth seeking society. We either solve all of our solvable problems that the incentives that govern us allow us to solve (which is most of our problems), or by definition, we do the best we absolutely can and leave the rest to nature.

Unfortunately we collectively suck at seeking truth. Which means we are far from doing the best we can.

In this process of turning us into a truth seeking species, there is nothing to celebrate in the immediate short-term. If we work according to the incentives, our progeny will be far better than we are today, but without immediate action from world leaders, there will be great suffering in our current world.

### Message to young people

This is your time to shine. These incentives and exponential improvement in technology means that very soon no credential and age barriers will be able to stop you from changing the world the way you want to.

If you read this book, at the least I believe you’ll realize just how deluded this world already is. The world is set up with organizations and institutions in such a way that leads to collective delusion.

Use this understanding to not shy away from tackling problems you might think are too big. There is no problem too big. And the biggest problems require you, not older people that spent their lives training their minds in ways that will no longer be useful. Please realize how deluded everyone is.

Dogmatically following someone’s instructions on what to learn, what to do, etc. is far more dangerous now than ever before.

Going against incentives will be like trying to swim up a waterfall. You should try it a couple of times to see what it’s like because you’ll figure out you can’t incredibly quickly. Feeling that pain is useful to train your subconscious to keep an eye out for it. By seeking truth about your feelings you’ll notice your subconscious communicating with you.

If you execute well, you will have the power to radically transform society how you want to. I predict that no company that exists today will be powerful 15 years (if that even). If they’re around they’ll be shells of their former selves.

You will replace them all with ones that are radically better.

It is my life’s mission to enable you.

### Message to world leaders

Without universal basic income or significant welfare structures in place for much of the world, there will be near term suffering. I would like us to minimize that suffering by acting preemptively. But if I look at history (as recently as COVID), it tells us that we will most definitely act too late. This is unfortunate.

You already know these incentives exist I’m sure. But you’re going to be blindsided by the rate of progress we’re about to see that will be predominantly based in nations that are maximizing transactions more than you, I’m also sure of.

**For nations lagging behind:** You don’t have time. Work closely with some nation that can provide some aid. You may have a revolution on your hands otherwise, sooner than you think. Seek truth and don’t be deluded into thinking that the root of your peoples’ unrest is some cultural war. When people are barely struggling to make a living and have hungry stomachs, they are bound to latch onto some reason to revolt. That reason on the surface level might not seem to have anything to do with your rapidly economy, but see past that delusion. Your analytics and numbers always lag behind reality. Account for that difference.

**For dictators:** Do what nations lagging behind will need to do and please join the larger global system. You will need to if you want to maintain your riches and lifestyle.

For nations that can help others: the incentives show that by helping out your fellow struggling nations, it will most definitely benefit you. You will have more transactions by having more participants in your economy… give it some time.

### Message to knowledge workers

Build awareness of your feelings and intuitions so that you bring more to the table than simply executing logic.

Your job will quickly morph from thinking through implementation details logically, to imagining the products you want, to be being able to simply feel which one is better. **Logic → imagination → feeling.**

A balanced mind will help you see the truths that present themselves more clearly - both in the realms of thinking and feeling.

### Why accelerate

You might have noticed what seems like a contradiction above: a truth seeking society will optimize incentives more strongly and will lead to an even faster change. Yet I’m pointing out that this transition will cause suffering, so why am I indirectly asking for it?

Because I am prioritizing children above everyone else, and there is only one way to prioritize them: to optimize for the incentives. Why? Because every day I see young people learning things that I know (based on the truths that I see in the world) will be completely outdated before they even get good at them. And this is even more true in communities that are already struggling.

I’m incapable of sitting around knowing that we can do something about the fact that someone who is already poor is learning things that are already less useful than what rich kids learn, and that what they’re learning will be completely useless incredibly fast.

I want a world with equality of opportunity (outside of inequalities of birth), and the incentives show that we can get there. Every child should have the same opportunity and a much higher average quality of life. We can get there.

Anyone that sees the truths the incentives show will have no choice but to work towards that bright future, for the sake of the young people that need us to. And the most effective way to work is by seeking truth.

You might not like the way the incentives are set up, but there’s no way to squash their truth by trying to hide it. If the incentives do influence our individual wants as I believe, then more accurate models of the incentives are bound to arrive into the world through many people near-simultaneously. Especially so as we get better at seeking truth.

Because the better our understanding of the incentives, the more they are amplified - just as the incentives want.

If you want to change them, change the root cause: the nature of your mind to want, and to get what you want as quick as possible. All the best trying!

The incentives show the direction.

We must do the hard work to walk it by seeking truth.
