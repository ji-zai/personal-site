# Definitions
- What are all the things involved in a system, and why.
- Simple system: f(x) = { x }
- Slightly more complex system. f (x = a, b) = { x, y }.
- Mapping the notion of a "system" to the real world and all of the real world "messiness". (give examples of a few systems).

### A system

To understand what I mean by seeking truth, we need to understand what a system is, its properties, and what a "truth" is in the context of a system.

A system is anything in which you can observe things happening. In most systems you can do something (action) and observe some reaction.

Our physical world is a system. I can perform actions in this system and see the system's reactions to my actions. For example, I can throw a ball up in the air and observe it fall back down.
