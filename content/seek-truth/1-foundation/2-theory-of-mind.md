### We are more similar than we think

When something deeply resonates with one person, it's bound to cross all boundaries between people. Globalization has shown this. Localization at surface level is all that's required.

Why is this? It's as if.

"When we started this project in Japan, one of the first things I was told was that this kind of thing would never appeal to American audiences. They said, 'Because the characters are in a very Japanese style, you cannot sell them to Americans'. So from the very beginning, I never thought there would be an English version. Now, it's just as popular in the United States [as in Japan], and I realized that we shouldn't always believe the opinions of conservative marketers."
