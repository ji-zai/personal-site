# Theory of mind
- Thinking, feeling, mental balance
### Thinking

### Feeling
Just how someone who is great at seeking truth by thinking can be be given any thinking system and effectively work their way through it, someone who is great at seeking truth in feeling can be put in any cultural context, any group of people and quickly pick up the new triggers for the same feelings.

### Mental balance
Now, you might think why even though some are more perceptive to feelings (they are able to observe them), they may still be unhappy or unbalanced? After all, doesn't understanding a system give you control over it?

Well, you gain control if you know how to implement what you understand about the system through actions in order to get what you want.

Even though many of us want to be mentally stronger (this is a thought), and can feel when we, say, feel strong fear in situations that we don't want to feel fear in (feeling awareness), we are still unable to overcome it. That's because we're missing the 3rd component: mental balance as an action.

It is possible to actively relax yourself. I think it's useful to think of mental balance as an action, and there is a muscle in the mind that enable you to implement mental balance.

A simple example, let's say you're afraid of going underwater. 

### We are more similar than we think
When something deeply resonates with one person, it's bound to cross all boundaries between people. Globalization has shown this. Localization at surface level is all that's required.

Why is this? It's as if.

"When we started this project in Japan, one of the first things I was told was that this kind of thing would never appeal to American audiences. They said, 'Because the characters are in a very Japanese style, you cannot sell them to Americans'. So from the very beginning, I never thought there would be an English version. Now, it's just as popular in the United States [as in Japan], and I realized that we shouldn't always believe the opinions of conservative marketers."
