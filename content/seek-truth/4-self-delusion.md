- Inability to seek truth in the medium of feeling hampers ability to seek truth in the medium of thinking. This inability to seek truth in the realm of feeling = delusion about what's actually happening in the mind, which impacts how you perceive the world.
- Give examples of companies that completely miss the truth even the truths that are sitting right in front of them.
### Collective delusion
Delusion is amplified by an order of magnitude, the more people you add.
